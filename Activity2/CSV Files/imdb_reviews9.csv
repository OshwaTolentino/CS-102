"maijita","23 August 2019","... with real, life-like animals. The lack of emotion and facial expressions makes you not get so attached.
Very much disliked the new song. Very much disliked Beyonce's unnesessary changes to the great song that is Can you feel the love tonight. Was also not too fond of other voice choises in this movie.
Six starts for the great story that The Lion King still is, but not even close to the same league with the original in the execution.
But I do not doubt that the children who have not seen the original would not love it.","

"TheLittleSongbird","3 December 2019","1994's 'The Lion King' is not just one of my favourite Disney films, it is also one of my favourite animated films and one of my favourites overall. Beautiful animation, some of Disney's most iconic songs and amazing score, an entertaining and powerful story with unforgettable moments, terrific voices (especially James Earl Jones and Jeremy Irons) and joint best beginning to a Disney film alongside 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame'.Disney's live action films are often frowned upon, they often have been described as pointless and many feel that Disney are running out of ideas. Can totally understand this, as the small handful that have been made so far have not really been necessary but the quality of them have varied. 'Cinderella' and 'The Jungle Book' were great and by far the best of the remakes, but the rest have left me mixed. Will admit to not really seeing the point of this version and was not massively impressed by the trailer, but saw it anyway being such a fan of Disney and because my sister desperately wanted to see it. Watching it way back when it first came out but with being behind with my reviewing it took me to now to review it, it was a little better than expected and not as bad as others have said. My sister did like it a lot better than me, with my feelings being quite lukewarm. Am really trying not to compare and try and judge it on its own terms, but sometimes it is hard when the quality of a remake, follow up or another adaptation is very far removed from something so good and that is the case with comparing both 'The Lion King' films.'The Lion King' (2019) does have good things. The best thing about it by a mile is the visuals, which are absolutely fantastic. Something of a technical achievement, with the scenery being breathtaking in every sense (""Circle of Life"" being a notable example) and the characters (excepting their eyes needing more expression) blend very realistically in a way where one gets the sense that this was a nature documentary. The score is still powerful, especially in the stampede and one of Disnney's most iconic tear-jerkers. Have always loved the songs, and with two exceptions they still make an impact. ""Circle of Life"" is truly awe-inspiring and the closest the film came to making me cry.Most of the dialogue has some moments of humour (Timon and Pumbaa) and tension (the hyenas). The story has its moments. Can not praise ""Circle of Life"" enough, Timon and Pumbaa are amusing and the stampede is intense, not goosebump-inducing though, even though everybody who has seen the original will know the outcome. Making the hyenas scarier and fleshing out the lionesses (a little) more were good moves. Actually thought that a lot of the voice work was not bad at all, Billy Eichner and Seth Rogan being so much fun and by far the best faring of the voices, they were clearly having fun too with the improvising and their comic timing is full of exuberance not obvious elsewhere. Florence Kasumba's Shenzai is very different, the opposite in fact, to Whoopi Goldberg's, and the more sinister edge worked very well. James Earl Jones, the only voice actor to reprise his role, still has Mufasa's booming dignity and Donald Glover does quite well.Didn't care for some however. Was mixed on John Oliver, who is fun but overdoes it at times. Beyonce comes over as very out of place, her voice not fitting how Nala looks, and she even sounded bored. Chiwetel Eijofor, a good actor who was brilliant in '12 Years a Slave', was the biggest disappointment, found him too subdued for Scar and he is nowhere near as menacing or enjoys himself as much as Irons (whose voice work is some of the best for any Disney, and animated, film). While ""Circle of Life"", ""I Just Can't Wait to be King"" and ""Hakuna Matata"" come off well (especially ""Circle of Life""), ""Be Prepared"" was bizarre and quite over the top, what a way to waste one of the greatest Disney villain songs. ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" was reminiscent of decent at best karaoke. ""Spirit"" is even worse, that did not fit within the film and was more an excuse for Beyonce to show off her vocal chops and have actually heard much better singing from her.Excepting the hyenas being scarier, some additional dialogue and the lionesses being more fleshed out, 'The Lion King' suffers from being too faithful and not having enough of its own identity. Too many of the scenes are near-carbon copies with only fleeting moments of heart and soul, mostly the film emotionally is very bland. The big death scene, heart-wrenching before, is treated in too throwaway a fashion. The additional dialogue and any interpolations are not for the better either and actually rather jar, while the cuts and changes were not necessary. The eyes and facial expressions for the characters, especially Scar, lack nuance and are at times borderline creepy.Summing up, found a lot to like but was disappointed overall. 6/10","

"ElMaruecan82","23 April 2022","If only it could move us inside...Let's be honest, Disney has never been a non profit-making organization and Uncle Walt was a man of vision AND economical flair. Still, before turning into a voracious corporate blob, Disney was still the quintessential dream factory and nostalgia builder for many, many, many generations. And even for these direct-to-video sequels that spread all over the 2000s like a bad cold, some brain cells of imaginations were mobilized.But now Disney's not even trying to pretend, investing all the efforts on a pure technical level and the kind of marketing-that-speaks-for-itself. It is one thing to adapt fairy tales into live-actions, before ""Cinderella"", there was ""Enchanted"", ""Maleficent"" or even Tim Burton's ""Alice in Wonderland"". And yet Disney executives found the trick: it's not about adapting the fairy tale but the Disney version of it. Thorns are still invisible over the head with the two round ears but right now in 2022, it seems that ""awakening your inner child"" isn't a motto anymore but a formula.The formula could have interesting results: the 2016 ""Jungle Book"" film could center on little Mowgli and diverged from the 1967 film. Same with ""Dumbo"" or ""Aladdin"". But exclusively animal-centered movies like ""The Lion King"", ""Bambi"" or ""The Lady and the Tramp"" are a different challenge. You've got to humanize the way animals could act, react or display emotions. Take the kiss between Lady and the Tramp, the magic is not within the moment their mouths meet but the cute and genuine embarrassment that follows. You can't ""animate"" these emotions with live-action animals with all the technology of the world.Indeed if your purpose is that your lion looks real, you can't expand the range of facial expressions: remember in ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"" the way Pongo and Perdita looked at each other at the end of the garden scene: reproducing that with real-looking animals is inconceivable, couldn't work, wouldn't work. And that's the ultimate wager of photorealistic remakes: achieve documentary-like realism with storylines that were designed for hand-drawn or at the very least CGI animation, ""Toy Story"" CGI I mean.And that leads to even more perplexing results when it comes to 'surreal' sequences like ""I Just Can't Wait to Be The King"" where two normal-looking cubs are casually running across pink flamingoes, or the moment that precedes Simba's epiphany where the figure of Mufasa is barely visible in the sky (not to mention that some lines were cut from the original). Now, maybe Disney takes for granted our passion for the ""Lion King"" and considers that we're there to ""fill the gaps"". It's true I did enjoy the film to the degree that it reminded of ""The Lion King"", which is a high point of my childhood, but at the end of the day, my mind was full of afterthoughts. To put it simple, I realized it was an enjoyment by proxy.The problem of ""The Lion King"" isn't that it's good or bad. It is certainly a remarkable achievement on the field of animation. The problem is that it is problematic. Yes I'm talking in circles but that's a circle Disney has just taken us into and that makes it rather impossible to figure what is wrong with these photorealistic films, we know there's something that doesn't look right, maybe on a pure reason-to-be way.""The Lion King"" is one of the classics of animation, a masterpiece that speaks highhy of the dedication of old-school Disney team of animators. 1995 would change the games with the first CGI and so in a way, ""The Lion King"" was the culmination of that traditional hand-drawn art. Not only that but its story, very simple and straightforward carried the gravitas and dramas or movie classics. Characters like Scar, Mufasa, Simba are all printed in our memories, the songs became pop culture monuments, scenes have been parodied countless times. ""The Lion King"" became a household name for Disney excellence. And certainly one of the greatest opening sequences of history, the shivers down your spine sent by the sight of Rafiki carrying little Simba is one of these moments you can't just 'duplicate'.As viewers pointed out, many things are missing: where is the friendly nod Mufasa gives Zazu? Or that hug between Rafiki and Mufasa? Mufasa comes across as a stone-faced patriarch posing like a library statue... and waiting for our nostalgic pheromones to instill some life in him .... Maybe we were just curious to see how they'd pull this out. I guess if I was told about an animated version of ""The Godfather"" no matter how ludricrous it sounds I would have given a shot. ""The Lion King"" was such a big deal, viewers did came to see and made it one of the highest grossing films of the year.Fair enough, but what's that does say exactly? That half the job was done and make a copy of something great to make something of equally promising greatness? The purpose of a remake is to bring something new. But ""The Lion King 2019"" doesn't bring anything new except for the realistic animation that doesn't look like an improvement anyway.. Scar looks like a washed out lion who shampooed his mane with paint thinner, without one tenth the suave charisma of the original. James Earl Jones' voice looks like he was only testing the microphone or was bored to death, which actually matched the look of the used-to-be majestic lion.And I swear the savannah and jungle never looked so dismal with tones of beige and yellowish green that reminded me of that Water Truce sequence in ""The Jungle Book"". So much for the bright colors and the escapism.... And the only thing visible right now are the thorns on the head, and the round ears have turned pointy... no it's not the devil, but a cow, a cash-cow.","

"MrGilgamesh","3 March 2020","Well...the visual effects are groundbreaking but it lacks heart and flare - and feels soulless compared to the original. Donald Glover and Beyoncé felt like miscasts - it feels like they're reading lines from a sheet. See this remake for the visual effects; but go back and watch the original animated masterpiece in all its glory.","

What type of bad singing was that? Completely disappointing !! (Movie and image quality are great, but I didn't like the music quality at all) by the way, John Oliver and Seth Rogen were great!!","

"slightlymad22","26 July 2019","I just got out of the Lion KingAnd I have to say it falls short of delivering for me. Elements of this new version are spectacular because of the quality of animation... But so much else was just mediocre... Starting with the poor voice talent. My favorite animated movies are brought to life by memorable distinctive voices... I loved what Burt Reynolds brought to All Dogs Go To Heaven, then Robin Williams set the bar with Aladdin, then we have Tom Hanks, Billy Crystal, Mike Myers, then Eddie Murphy... The list is long but those films wouldn't have been the same without those voices. This new Lion King film has none of that... it's all just so flat.About 80% of this, is shot for shot/word for word the same as the 1994 classic. Although there is a subplot involving Scar and Sarabi from the Broadway show inserted.My next issue was the soundtrack... Again, there is nothing special here. The 1994 soundtrack was one of the all-time best. I hated Beyoncé singing Can You Feel The Love Tonight. I am not a fan of hers anyway, and her appeal is totally lost on me, but I can acknowledge when she is good as in Goldmember.Finally, and my biggest issue... The realistic non-expressions of the animals. Because you can't see happy or sad in their faces, you fully depend on the mediocre delivery of dialog. This was very distracting. The lion's faces do not show sad... happy... scared. This was like watching a two hour voice over.I found it less entertaining and engrossing than Aladdin and Dumbo, although at times I did enjoy this movie. I can safely say I will never watch it again, and will stick with my 1994 classic, So for me, this was just a mediocre unnecessary remake while showcasing perhaps the greatBest animation ever.","

"DJKwa","12 July 2019","As nature documentaries go, the modern remake of The Lion King (2019) gives some of the best a run for their money, quite literally. With a $250 million price tag, it achieves digitally what David Attenborough has spent his life capturing on camera. The result is jaw-droppingly photorealistic, but it also makes for a strange first impression. Imagine watching a Disneynature feature but with actors reading The Lion King screenplay over the top of it and the effect would be eerily similar. It takes time to accept lifelike looking animals talking like cartoon characters, but the ground-breaking technical skill in which they are brought to life makes the bumpy journey worthwhile.Every tress of fur, crack in the arid soil and sun-swept vista is rendered in such immense detail that it's unsurprising that many people are calling this reboot live-action. It's a monumental technical achievement and the level of visual fidelity on display alone warrants seeing this film on the biggest screen possible.However, in terms of the story, the film follows the original so closely that it can't help but feel second rate. Scene-by-scene, it dutifully ticks off the story beats of the 1994 original, with little by way of surprises in-between. It also doesn't help that film's photo-realism unavoidably limits the ability of the animals to convey emotion without looking unnatural or (naturally) cartoonish, and the result is a film that often creates indifference where there should be wonder. With jaw-dropping visuals, plenty of humour and solid renditions of timeless songs, it's hard to see this modern remake failing but, as it turns out, The Lion King's (2019) biggest achievement also ends up being its biggest flaw.","

"Lepidopterous_","23 July 2019","This remake manages to suck all the life out of the original. It really is like watching National Geographic while hearing The Lion King (1994) on in the other room. There is a total disconnect between what you are seeing on-screen and what you are hearing or supposed to feel-so much that I am surprised this was not noticed early on and left on the cutting room floor. Baloo in Favreau's The Jungle Book (2016) alone should have been a warning sign.At its best, the soundtrack is only as good as the original. I was waiting out for Beyoncé and Donald Glover hoping maybe they would save it with charm, humor, or chemistry, but Beyoncé oversings/overacts and Glover's few moments just aren't enough. John Oliver does steal his scenes as Zazu and I'm a fan of Scar's character design. Visual effects are extremely well done, but for a production that looks so true-to-life, most of the film is lifeless.Very disappointed.","

"Breumaster","27 December 2019","I think it sure must be a lot of brain work to imagine how the real scenes in Afrika will match with the animations. Jon Favreau, which I do admire for his works, did a real good and visionary job, and so did the camera department and the animators. I really liked the little changes that show a more developed story than the full animated original. I would give it the full 10/10, if there would have been a better dub in Germany, because not all of the voices did fit. Scar's voice was way too soft. But that's not the only voice. When it came to the sequence with Timon and Pumbaa, it really got very strong and had funny moments, I didn't expect. If Walt Disney could see it, he would be delighted. For most of his 22 (!) Oscars he was awarded for animal documentations. This movie unites both worlds of cinema - fictional animated and dramatized story with landscape documentations. I like how the animals look and specially how they move! The story is all in all the same.","

"matthewssilverhammer","26 July 2019","My question going into the latest ""pay-us-for-your-nostalgia"" Disney-remake was, ""Why do we need this? What new can it bring?"". Technically, the CGI animation is impressively state-of-the-art and new. Otherwise, my worst fears were warranted. It's not just similar to its source material but is 100% the same in almost every aspect. From moment one, when the iconic ""NAAAH SA-VIN-YAAAH!"" bursts forth, I realized they were so beholden to the '94 classic they didn't even bother rerecording that vocal. It sets the stage for both the larger things (story beats / scenes), as well as the smaller things (specific line deliveries), to be a lazy karaoke tune. So frustratingly unimaginative, it makes 2019's Aladdin look like a feat of original storytelling.
Thankfully, the greatness of the story is left untouched, though it was already plenty great without being redone. The few things that are changed don't expand the story, but just extend scenes past the point of reasonable story economics. We're forced to sit through self-congratulatory animation montages that are useless beyond ""look what we did!""
Crowds seem to be going for the cast, and many of those performances are the highlights. Listening to Glover & Beyonce sing together is special, Scar is decently rendered, and Rogen & Eichner offer the most unique and successful moments. Still, with dialogue so slavish, you can sense the actors desperately trying not to copy what they grew up hearing.
Honestly, even the technical brilliance is often a hindrance. By making the animals photoreal, we take away individual personalities, physical nuances, and even facial expressions, all of which help us relate to their plight. So, again I ask, why do we need this?","

RUINED by terrible acting , TERRIBLE Direction, just HORRIBLE! WHO the HELL made these decisions??!! With the very few dialog add ons WHY would you re cast WHY????? Why would you remove Jeremy Irons as Scar?? WHY??? Why would you put emotionless actors as Simba, Nala etc..

"dalefl","21 July 2019","For the people who are saying that Walt Disney stated in his will that he wanted the movies to be remade every 10 years: That is not even close to what he said. What is in his will is his desire to have the movies re-released into theaters in order for new generations to enjoy them. That was a common practice throughout Disney's history and he just wanted it to continue after he was gone.As far as this one goes, I was hoping for better. Nice CGI, the music is good, but the voice acting was barely passable and it lacked the emotion that was such a big part of the original. Overall very disappointing.","

However, the naive Simba believes in his envious uncle Scar that wants to kill Mufasa and Simba to become the next king. He lures Simba and his friend Nala to go to a forbidden place and they are attacked by hyenas but they are rescued by Mufasa. Then Scar plots another scheme to kill Mufasa and Simba but the cub escapes alive and leaves the kingdom believing he was responsible for the death of his father. Now Scar becomes the king supported by the evil hyenas while Simba grows in a distant land. Sometime later, Nala meets Simba and tells that the kingdom has become a creepy wasteland. What will Simba do?""The Lion King"" is an unnecessary remake of the 1994 animated film. The songs are boring and the nice images tell a story without soul.

"n-middleton-117","20 August 2021","When you take one of the greatest stories to grace the silver screen and then combine it with exceptional visual effects, you'd expect the end product to be a wonderful contemporary refresh, ready to captivate young hearts and minds all over again. However, in the process of trying to out a slightly new spin on the Lion King, they've tampered with some elements that have detracted from the value of the film.So many reboots of classic films have fallen victim to the same adaption of storyline's to try and appease more contemporary audiences, but almost always end up being worse. The Lion King doesn't deviate from the original script and story as much as some other modern remakes, but it does still mix it up. Some of the changes arguably a small improvement, but some are significantly worse. The original film has so many subtle lessons, but sadly some of the best ones have been altered or removed entirely in this new version.Overall, the story is still close enough to the original to be decent, and the visual effects are quite remarkable. Although, the animals' faces appear somewhat dull, as the hyper realism doesn't allow for the same range of expression as the original cartoon.Overall, it's not a bad interpretation of the original, but a far cry from stellar heights of its predecessor. It's a movie that definitely didn't need to happen though.","

"Box_mixman","22 November 2019","When I was a kid, I knew lots of peers who loved the original, the singing and everything, I didn't think too much of it then, the singing was too much.
But I have grown more fond of it, and this new one was really great!. Almost made this 33yo guy sing along and wish for more, especially once I saw Timon and Pumba, I had forgotten about those!. Hakuna Matata!.The visuals are also very stunning!, this is perhaps the most detailed work I have seen yet, in certain scenes you could think it was filmed in reality.The few things I didn't like was that it actually felt like many scenes just.. just.. needed a little more time, talking 5-30seconds. To get a little more involved with few of the characters, just to see them more, because it felt like they were passing by just to show things a few times, otherwise they were so great in conveying emotion, movement, often.With all this said, I also hope they still will do more ""real"" cartoons in the old style, the aim shouldn't be to always just make it advanced in tech, but also I don't think this movie suffers from it.
I am not a mega fan of the original who's seen that one many times, so I can't comment on what might have been left out or whats different.","

"ironhorse_iv","24 January 2020","It's sad because this I was really looking forward to seeing what filmmakers Jon Favreau & Jeff Nathanson could do to make to make this photorealistic computer animation not live action remake stand out from Disney's classic animated 1994 film of the same name. Yet this film heavily influenced by Shakespeare's 'Hamlet' & Japanese anime ""Kimba the White Lion' felt like a rethread. Don't get me wrong, the story of Simba (Voiced by Donald Glover) having to retake his kingship does have some new things going for it. However the added backstory of how the villain got his name & how the famine start didn't really enhance the viewing experience. Honestly it lean more to becoming a bigger illogical plot hole on why the lionesses would continue to follow his lead knowing full well that he once challenge Mufasa (Voiced by James Earl Jones), force their queen for sex & continue to mistreated them. After all in this adaptation, Chiwetel Ejofor's version doesn't have the Machiavellian charm that Jeremy Irons brought in the original movie to make them trust him. To add onto that, Scar is not ruthless powerful enough to overtake their physical strength both in size and numbers if they rebelled. In the original he was. After all, he killed most of the Lion Guards including Nala (Voiced by Beyonce Knowles)'s father. In this movie, he's just an untrustworthy scrawny recluse whom cover story doesn't make much sense. He didn't even knock out the witness. Instead he exiled Zazu (Voiced by John Oliver) yet the bird still considering warn the lionesses of his lying. So you would think that the cover story would be expose long ago. On a similar beat, even if Scar didn't get cocky in deus ex machina way and expose the truth about Mufasa's death like an idiot. The lionesses didn't ask the wildebeests what happen in the first place seem odd. Even if the herd are sentient. Lionesses should be more willing to hear Simba out when he come back. He could expose who led him into the gorge to practice roaring. The only thing I can think of the pride thinking otherwise is if a Scar follower like Zira was introduce into the film. That or Simba having shown severe psychological issues or seem more physical mangy than Scar. After all, no lion will became a strong mane just by eating bugs. All this could had made the ending more logically. Still this remake needs more humor. I hate that the comic relief aspects are toned down to make everything gritty including the hyenas with no Ed. They now lack less personality, nowhere near expressive and are taken too serious. Yet the biggest letdown is how the film interpreted Hakuna Matata. According to Timon (Voiced by Billy Eichner) & Pumbaa (Voiced by Seth Rogen), there is no circle of life only a meaningless line of indifference. The way they said it, made responsibility free philosophy seem highly negative & nihilism than fun. No wonder they seem more coldblooded and open to help the carnivores killed their fellow animals. Don't get me wrong, they may have protection due to their closeness with Simba, but there still a famine going on. The chance of them getting eaten is high. Anyhow, the filmmakers still ruin the enjoyable humor with them. For example, jokes about being a pig is turn into a somber forced message about standing against bullies. It's unfunny PC comedy at its worst. Padding also made the movie suffer. 88 minutes runtime is now 2 hrs. The flick really wanted to prove that there is more of a Circle of Life than Hakuta Matata by painfully showing long sequences of fur travelling in the wind or a mouse wandering around. Talking about Circle of Life. I do find it odd that the lions has achieved harmony with the animals they eat by exodus hyenas under the pretense that they weren't part of it like an evil diaspora. The idea that they overhunt is outrageous. In real life, hyenas are vital components the ecosystem. They gotten a bad wrapped in these folktales. Simba should figure out a way to coexist with them. Another unique thing the movie could had done is use more of the Broadway Musical beside the trailer. At least, most of the original songwriters return to add new touches to their memorable hits even if the visuals to follow it are a bit lackluster. For example 'I Just Can't Wait to Be King' & ""Be Prepared"" sequences just doesn't compared to the fun original trippy animation with the cubs doing circus tricks or gusto delivery of strong fascism imageries of the hyenas. Then there is the opening of ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"" whom visuals also don't match the tone as it is still board daylight when sung. It also sucks that the triumphant score played over Simba racing back was replaced with ""Spirit"". It doesn't quite have the same heroic tone need for the audience to understand his journey. As for voice acting. Besides Ejofor being way off, most of the other performers were alright even if Beyoncé has her limits, Rogen can't sing and Jones sounds old. However it was very jarring to see the filmmakers remove nearly all range of human-like anthropomorphizing expressions. It made true to life creatures look so emotionless & stilted. Sadly making the animals move realistic also hurt the action as the film kinda screw up Simba's childhood pinning move. Even memorable spiritualism moments like Mufasa's physically spirit appearing in the clouds is tone down. Very little emotional punch. Regardless the CGI looks vivid accurate. Still overall I'll probably not see this remake again. The highest grossing animated movie of all time as of this writing is not really worth stepping foot on the lion den again and getting bit. That's for sure. I'll stick to the original.","

"Vartiainen","9 August 2019","I did not want to see this movie. I did not want the Mouse to think that I in any way support this new trend of simply remaking old Disney classics with wooden actors and sparkling CGI. But alas, I was dragged into the movie theatre anyway, and here I am, telling you that I'm deeply ashamed that the Great Black Mouse of Disney has my money. Yet again.Because I was right in not wanting to see this film. Because this is the bottom of the barrel. The other movies have kind of been shot for shot remakes, but every single one of them has had at least something new. Some other angle, some twist, to make it interesting. This, one the other hand? Holy cow in heaven, is this bad. The beginning, for example. You know, The Circle of Life, one of the most recognizable and striking movie openings in history. The exact same. Shot for shot, camera angle for camera angle, the exact same. Except, you know, not as colourful, iconic or fetching. Because it's supposed to look real. Which in this case apparently means that everything looks either more wrinkled, dusty and/or dirty in general. Because that's Serengeti for you. According to the film makers.Luckily they stopped with the exact shot for shot soon after that, thank heavens, but that was only a minor relief. Because you know what else happens, when you try to make everything look as real as possible? Aside from everything looking like it's going to give you fleas. It makes everything look emotionless! Lions are not exceptionally renowned for their wide range of facial expressions, you know. The reason you can make animated movies with animals as the main characters is because animation doesn't care that lions can't have facial expressions. You can go outside the realms of biology and what's strictly speaking possible. You can exaggerate, emote and play loose with the rules. You can use colours, shapes and perspectives to compensate, to make it look interesting. This film has none of that! It's a dull, emotionless, flat table reading of dialogues we all know and love, but which are given nothing to support them.Not helping the matter is the fact that they hired celebrity voice actors. These people are talented entertainers, yes, and they look fetching on a poster, but none of them is exactly renowned for their voice acting capabilities. And boy does that show! Even James Earl Jones sounds like he's about to keel over and pass beyond the veil at any moment. There's very little of the majesty and gravitas of the original Mufasa left in his performance.And I actually misspoke earlier. This thing has one new thing in it. A song. A song by Beyonce, named Spirit. Because apparently that was the price of getting her on board. Or perhaps Disney wants an Original Song Oscar nomination. I don't know, but the song is awful and feels exactly like what it is. A forced, jammed in last-minute addition.Saints in heaven, was this a bad movie. It's a bit over a week after I saw it, but writing this review actively ruined my morning. I feel awful even thinking about this. About the fact that Disney has made incredible amounts of money with this. That they're going to keep making these.And I contributed to it. I think I might be sick. Excuse me.","

The only problem is that there is not much emotion, but otherwise it's still joyful, funny and visually stunning. The songs are not very good, especially ' Can you feel the love tonight' sounds like a cash-grab and 'Be Prepared' is horrible. If you haven't watched The Lion King, I recommend watching the 1994 original rather than this. It's just like a pastime and not really memorable. I must admit that a year after I watched it in theatres in July 2019, in 2020, I could not remember a thing from this movie. It's somehow very forgettable. I watched it again this year. Good movie but huge degrade from the original. Aladdin remake was much better. Please just watch the original. I start crying every time when I watch the original, when the movie starts and I don't know why, but I never do for this remake. It's just so soulless.","

The problem I find is that the film is rather slow and monotonous. The constant arid background gets boring. It is like watching National Geographic, only more boring. The only good thing is the presence of the two friends of Simba, they provide comic relief with the songs with changed lyrics.","

"jackson_ro","16 November 2019","Undoubtedly gorgeous, filled with a memorable story, song and characters, but definitely not as magical as the original. Watching the newest Lion King feels like I'm watching the Discovery Channel, as the scene and animals are incredibly lifelike, but that is also the problem, all the silliness of the original was taken out just so the film could be more of a visual masterpiece. In the end, this iteration is simply a CGI masterpiece featuring a great story, and not one of the greatest movie of all time.","

The only problem is that I know the 1994 movie way so well that I can even recall all the lines, so everything about this movie becomes way too predictable. With that said, I don't mind reliving the childhood memories once again, and I would recommend this movie to the new generation.","

It brings a whole joy of magic of Disney and wonders, all over again. The Lion King is one of the best instant classic Disney remakes of another generation to remember the King of Pride Rock. It's a very beautiful live-action film, like the original. They did the exact same lines and scenes from the original, but in a different way of making something new out of it. And it can make you laugh, cry, and feel the love for this movie to have fun and enjoy for the whole family.","

"jackgdemoss","25 July 2019","For only rating this movie as a 7/10, I sure feel like I have a lot to say about it. The vision of the film was clearly to make the most realistic version of the classic tale as possible, and it succeeded spectacularly in that way. The wildlife and natural scenery were bar none in the world of CGI grounded in realism. This also happens to be its greatest downfall, however. By creating ultra-realistic lions, they sacrifice a huge part of what made the original lion king so special: emotional expressivity in the faces of the animals. So now we have reached an interesting point in our movie-tech, where we can create animation that looks worse but portrays human emotion well, or we can make things hyper-realistic. I look forward to the day we can have both. The voice acting cast was phenomenal. Specifically, John Oliver, Donald Glover, and Seth Rogan came out to play. Beyonce and Glover were interesting to hear sing together, with Glover holding down the lower, constant melodies, and Beyonce controlling the song. There were times that it felt Beyonce was going a bit too far and the character no longer felt like Nala, but rather, Beyonce.","

"JamesIan2021","29 July 2019","After the torture of sitting through 2019 Aladdin as well as Dumbo, I actually at first refused to see this remake of The Lion King, mostly because the original is a near masterpiece, to many as well as myself, and watching it as a kid religiously, it seemed completely pointless remaking such a fantastic film that hasn't aged a day.However, as me and my fellow Cineworld card holders have cleared the cinema roster, The Lion King was the only thing on this weekend we hadn't seen. So I sucked it up and caved in and went with my mates. I wish I'd stayed at home.This is a hollow, bland, dull and completely vapid, shameless cash-grab from Disney. A visually beautiful yet dramatically and emotionally inept movie. The animals look photo real and that's an achievement, but without the expressive faces seen in the original, you can't buy into the drama and emotion. This is a shot for shot remake without the beauty, fun and heart of the 1994 classic.There's no magic, and that's what Disney prides itself on. The newly added scenes bring nothing but more length to this extremely slow remake. The colour, pop and brightness of the original are nowhere to be seen this time, instead we get a rather sepia looking film, any given David Attenborough documentary has more colour, style and emotion than this film.The cast are a mixed bag. Donald Glover couldn't be any more boring as older Simba, he sounds like he's either high or falling asleep. Beyonce brings some class to Nala but doesn't get a lot of screen time. Chjwetel Ejiofor who I normally love gave me a headache, and John Oliver is painful to listen to. Keegan-Michael Key feels like he's been stolen from another movie and dumped here and it doesn't work, though Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen, surprisingly, did a good job.There's nothing remarkable about this film bar its visuals. It's just a cold, pointless remake that some will enjoy due to recognising certain shots which will trigger nostalgia. Even the kids in the cinema last night were wondering around bored, distracted and fidgeting, because the film has nothing to offer. Comedy falls flat, emotions are zero and what can be said other than it's just a pale imitation of a beloved classic. Well done Disney on churning out another pile of dung remake that's hit the billion dollar mark.","

"HorrorDonLeash","20 March 2021","It's pretty much like everyone else is saying: It's beautiful, but it's missing the heart the original has. But I expected that going in. The original is sort of untouchable. Plus it was a cartoon, this is not a cartoon. Overall, it was was better than I expected it to be.The story is the same as the original. They didn't change much, they just mostly took the cartoony parts out so it would be more realistic, which I was fine with. It wasn't a complete shot-for-shot remake, but pretty close. They changed the lines a bit and there were some funny parts. Definitely more of a recreation of the original.The voice acting isn't amazing. I liked Zazu, Timon and Pumba the most. Mufasa is still the same voice (good call, Disney), the hyenas were pretty good, and Scar was mostly good. Young Simba and Nala were fine (young's Nala's singing voice was impressive!). Adult Simba was okay but I hated Beyoncé for Adult Nala. She was just god awful. And somehow she butchered Can you feel the love tonight. Wow. And That song has never been my favorite... but the new one is just so much worse. Very cringey..So now for the best part. The CGI. I have NEVER seen anything like it. Just ridiculously gorgeous, I couldn't believe how much work went into this. I had to stop the movie in the beginning to google if I was watching an actual live action movie with CGI over it. Nope, totally CGI. Incredible. That right there makes it worth the watch.This movie is a one-time watch for me. I would say it's worth it if you've got nothing else going on and you wanted to experience it for the beautiful CGI and indulge in a little nostalgia.","

Despite the movie being almost two hours, the movie was rushed - they rushed into the songs, which were artless and dull regarding the setting; one of the songs was tragically shorten; and Beyonce (adult Nala) had very little screen-time in the film.Worst of all, there was NO EMOTION, MAGIC, HUMOR. Only good things were Hans Zimmer, Elton John, and James Earl Jones. The visuals were good, but they don't make up for the movie at all.","

But anyways, the cast was great too expect for Scar and Nala who I think were miscast. I really miss Scar's English accent and sarcasm and Nala's voice in Can You Feel the Love Tonight was way too powerful... It's almost like Donald Glover was a background singer.","

"totalovrdose","12 July 2019","The Lion King is great - that is a fact. The original animated film is Disney gold, and this film captures that, for the most part, incredibly well. But...so often, the film is just a carbon copy of the original, scene for scene, with the same soundtrack, songs, cinematography and moments. True, there are some additional scenes added in, and some changes do occur, don't get me wrong, and occasionally, John Oliver as Zazu and Seth Rogen as Pumbaa insert some alternate, and very funny lines, but the film is, at its core, so close to being a mirror image to the original, that it's surreal. I will admit, the special effects are utterly perfect, and truly breathtaking to watch. It is impossible to tell this utterly perfect work of art apart from reality. That aside, it is still just a copy. Who has seen The Poseidon Adventure? Who saw The New Poseidon Adventure? Who saw Poseidon? All different - similar story, but each offer their own unique take on the narrative. Who saw Godzilla 1954? Who saw the 1997 American remake? (God help me, I'm actually using this film to make a point). Who saw Godzilla 2014? Each of these films bring something new to the properties, with each project being vastly different. The Lion King however, is thoroughly predictable.Some people will argue that is a good thing, and I understand that. Those I saw the movie with this evening said it reminded them of their childhood; their old friends, and what they used to do. It was incredibly nostalgic and melancholic for them, and I can't deny that I occasionally felt chills just watching it (in a good way, mind you). Donald Glover and Beyoncé absolutely knock it out of the park with their rendition of the tunes, and their voice acting of the central protagonists was really on the mark (though Beyoncé deserved significantly more opportunities because, you could just tell, she was loving the role). Florence Kasumba as hyena leader, Shenzi, was a definite stand out; she brought an undeniable sinisterness to the role that was absent from the animated feature, and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar was just sublime. Ejiofor's voice alone gave amazing presence to the film, capturing Scar's cunning ruthlessness, making him just as appealing an antagonist as ever. As for James Earl Jones as Mufasa, what can I say? I could listen to that man's voice all day long - he still managed to offer some changes in the way he performed his lines in contrast with the original, despite there again, being vast similarities, and it was brilliant to listen to him give the grand king life once more.The changes to the elephant graveyard scene were especially brilliant, and the many new faces added to the habitat that Timon and Pumbaa inhabit were cute, cuddly and added more character to the environment, making it feel more lived in. One massive change from the film however, is the significant lack of any physical emotions. Though the actors deserve kudos for the emotive performances they provide, the faces of the animated characters presenting these lines, remind stoic at best, even in the most emotive moments. Don't get me wrong, this feature still has some emotively powerful occasions, though some of the animated films most tragic moments did not affect me as dearly in this adaptation, whereas others had an even more profound affect.At the end of the day, I would recommend this movie, however, so much that it does right, is just lifted from the original. As a teacher, I often tell my students that copying is a bad thing - having your own spin on it, and adding your own personality to something, to make it your own, is what makes it great, and I just wish that director, Jon Favreau, would have taken the opportunity to do something more with this beloved classic.","

"kaydrelia","21 July 2019","Lion King was the only movie growing up that actually made me cry, the soundtrack alone was amazing, but there was a magic in the cartoon version. This new one is awful. They spent tons of money on the tech and actors, but forgot to add the magic. This isn't the Lion Queen, it's not about beyonce, but it's become all about her, when she didnt actually bring anything to the movie. James Earl Jones will never get a bad review in my book, he did his job. Everyone else was simply forgettable. The cartoon version I remember each actor, each song, each joke, etc and I havent watched it in years. My guess is that Disney is making all these worthless remakes to maintain the copyrights of those movies, but there's 0 intention to do it with the same magic and formula that captivated people from the beginning. The only remake I've enjoyed so far is Cinderella, we even bought it. The rest I don't even remember and my kids prefer the cartoon versions over the remakes now too, that should say something. Not that anyone at Disney will care, their goal is to take over everything to continue being in control and taking in heaps of money for their own exploits. I'll stick with the original Lion King, including the soundtrack and the Broadway show (also amazing), and never speak of this waste of money of a film again.","

"thibault-li","1 August 2019","It is now obvious that The Lion King story doesn't suit the Live Action movie format.
Because of its realism, the movie loses the expressivity, fantasy and humor of the original one. The songs have been shorten and some dialogues have been rewritten, only not for the better.
At least, the movie could have been smarter. It is in certain points, some incoherences have been fixed but not all, but in general the ideas lack of developments.
Jon Favreau may not have been the better choice because he is not really good at filming landscapes (I already saw it in The Jungle Book). James Cameron (Avatar) and Ang Lee (Life of Pi) would have done a better job.I had shed a tear or two in some key scenes, but it was very modestly made.
Doubtlessly, this movie has been made only for money's sake.","

It's impossible to make people happy! Its hard to turn something into live action and change things around to fit into the live action area. Half of these 1* ratings are just angry in general because they don't like what Disney is doing with their animated features because they think that they are too close to the original or because they love the originals too much and don't want them remade. Then the other half of the 1* ratings are because they changed things and they are not word for word exactly like the originals.....
Disney has done it all, so now they are focused on turning their wonderful animated features into live action movies. I personally absolutely LOVE what they have been doing!!! All of them, we have been collecting them all as well can through the Disney Movie Club... My kids have absolutely loved them as well, and it has been nice to have a few movies this summer (mostly Disney) that I have been able to take them to see. My daughter and I are especially looking forward to The Little Mermaid!!!
As far as I am concerned they can remake all of their animated features and we will see them all and collect them to add to all the animated features we have collected (which is all of them). The basic stories of most have been the same with some change to the details line wise (I have the animated movies memorized at this point and the movies do differ a tad in detail) ... A couple have deviated a bit i.e. Maleficent (Sleeping Beauty) and Dumbo, but they are all wonderful and we have loved all of them so far including Aladdin, The Lion King and my absolute favorite Beauty and the Beast.
I absolutely LOVE that James Earl Jones returned as Mufasa... I do wish Jeremy Irons had returned as Scar, but it is what it is. Still loved it.

"jonatan_juntunen","17 July 2019","Isnt it a bit hypocritical to see people complaining bout this remake? People are always whining about how a remake should always stick to the sourcematerial, and when it doesn't people whine. Yes, this might be a moneygrab, isnt that quite obvious? But in the end, who the f- cares? This movie was a masterpiece, it was bound to be, since its a shot by shot near remake. Yes, the animated will always be the original, but if we are honest, this is a new era, updating the movies is a must for future generations, no matter if you like the fact that classic animation is dying. This movie is also animation, and a revouloutionary one aswell. Also, sometimes remakes are needed for us to appreciate the original. Now - Enjoy this masterpiece, an updated version of a story that was a good one. Thank you for bringing back my childhood. And mostly, thank you for not ruining it.","

"tetrahex","15 November 2019","The power of CG without soul or purpose. I watched the 4k in all its unsettling starkness, crisp hairs beside mud mouthed lip sink animation that just doesn't quite seem real. Like the previous remakes, things passable in animation are just creepy when made real. The animation in general is 99% there which just makes that 1% stand out all the more, and that's the problem, you are never immersed, because its just an examination of the artificial, a second rate copy of a first class original. Add the new woke stunt casting when the original chose the best fit for the job and this just becomes a first rate turd, not entertaining, just insulting to watch.","

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","21 July 2019","'The Lion King (2019)' certainly looks phenomenal: its 'photo-realistic animation' actually looks photo-real (or pretty much as close to it as we've come so far) on more than one occasion. The environments often seem so real you could touch them, the water simulation is perhaps the best I've ever seen and the animals all move, essentially, as realistically as CG creatures have ever moved. However, this does mean that the movie lacks most of the flair usually associated with animated works, even going so far as to omit emotion in favour of realism. The characters, whom are all inevitably anthropomorphised to some degree, don't really emote. Aside from providing ample range in their vocal performances, they remain as stony-faced as animals of their kind usually do. It's lucky that, for the most part, the cast do a terrific job at conveying everything that needs to be conveyed. However, when the singing starts, the believability of the vocal work starts to stretch beyond its limits; it just doesn't look like these lions, with their limited jaw-range and general lack of visual articulation, are belting out the big notes that they're supposed to be. Again, it's a good job that the songs are as genuinely entertaining as they are. Sadly, the picture can't claim to own any of them - except for a couple of originals that seem strangely out of place. On top of that, the musical sequences themselves aren't all that inspired, especially when compared to the original 'The Lion King (1994)'. I mean, the big, colourful, montage-esque numbers from that flick are here replaced by often stiff and generally just sort of bland ones. The same is true, I suppose, of the whole affair. It doesn't change anything in terms of narrative but somehow makes things longer and less energetic. Of course, this is all in favour of its realist aesthetic, but it does make you wonder whether that's a wise choice. After all, why does this Shakespearean musical about talking lions need to be realistic? The end result is far less memorable than the 1994 classic; it's not as vibrant, lively or dynamic. It still tells an engaging, effective and occasionally emotionally-affecting story, though. I can't deny that it's a fair bit of fun. It's not so much new as nostalgic, almost like an experiment on a large scale. It ultimately doesn't really feel worth the effort, however, because I'd rather watch the original and I think pretty much everyone else would, too. In five years time, will this be remembered as a classic? No, it'll be remembered as a remake. It's a shame, as the technical work involved with it really is astounding. The true artistry required to make this work would probably have been better spent elsewhere. I suppose it's just a product of the cinematic circle of life, though. In twenty-five years time, I guess we can expect an animated remake of this (so-called) 'live-action' effort. 6/10","

"thaddeuscharles","23 August 2023","2019 Lion King still shines but the remake is not as good as original. The original Lion King is so good that even this version still has moments of greatness. Furthermore, the computer generated landscapes are magnificent (at times I was literally in awe with the realistic beauty created) but some changes were NOT beneficial:1. Beyoncé casting and solo song didn't blend with vibe of film. ""Are you with me, lions!""2. Timon and Pumbaa were not as funny.3. Shenzi the Hyena as the leader which is a decent and acceptable change in this version.4. Cartoon version was extremely more emotional expressive.","

"eddie_baggins","19 July 2019","To put it simply, weighed up against one another in a battle for ultimate supremacy, the original animated classic from 1994 would win the battle for The Lion King pride land in knockout fashion.Full of heart, soul, imagination and of course singalong worthy songs and emotionally powerful music, the Disney classic of old still stands up today as a worthy cultural touchstone and while this new virtually carbon copied version of the tale of Simba and his quest to act out his kingly duties is still entertaining enough, Jon Favreau's visually sumptuous yet instantly forgettable redo is a relatively cold and unnecessary cash grab from the global behemoth that is the mouse house.From the moment the film starts with the ""I see Kenya"" made famous in the original, as animals of all shapes and sizes gather to witness the unveiling of lion king Mufasa's newly born cub Simba, Favreau's film sets itself in motion to be a risk free affair that while stunning with its downright eye-popping mastery of visuals, fails to capture the audience's heart like the 1994 original did with ease, for those of all ages.It's a shame for such a visual feast that Favreau and his Disney bosses failed to think of new ways to add a different flavour to proceedings here, as while there's some neat visual gags, added jokes (mainly courtesy of the films MVP's Timon and Pumbaa, voiced by Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen) and some of the songs remain a joy to listen to without bettering the original, this version of The Lion King plays it way to safe without doing anything else of note that would make you choose to watch this take over the briefer and more energetic original.Another curious element to the film is with Disney's insistence on going ""photo real"" they have managed like other live action re-doings to lose sight of some of the beloved characters that came to life in the original animations.Here of course we have our cute and adorable and eventually fearsome Simba, the feisty Nala, comic relief Zazu and many more of the characters many know and love (or despise) but with the realism attached to these once animated figures much of the simplistic wonder and stretching of the imagination disappears and so too does much of the whimsy and loveable aspects.Most notable in how the film deals with its musical numbers, as many will notice the outlandish nature of many of the original set pieces (such as Scar's Be Prepared Nazi like sequence or Can You Feel the Love Tonight taking place in the day time!) are now transformed into more plain set-ups that while looking great, lack the spark and memorability of what we've come to know and therefore expect.It all brings in to question the very being of these Disney reimagining's, that while perfectly watchable and seriously profitable (other than poor old Dumbo), makes one wonder what the whole point of the whole escapade is other than Disney taking a seriously easy route to making quick and easy money.If other future installments fail to add anything else of note like The Lion King, you can't help but feel much like the never spoken about Beauty and the Beast remake or the over praised Jungle Book, many of these experiences will go down as cold hearted money earners that very few would recall in future years as anything but entertaining distractions.Final Say -No doubt set to be one of the great box-office behemoths of all-time, this modern day Lion King provides much wonder for the eyes but offers very little else of note to lay hold on. Perfectly watchable but instantly disposable, Jon Favreau's film is a prime example that realism doesn't equal better when your film is stuck in auto-pilot.3 juicy grubs out of 5","

"mattrochman","23 July 2019","This really was not worth making. The first one was a masterpiece, so the thinking behind a carbon copy with different performers and visuals is baffling.I might be in the minority, but the stage show did little for me - a lame remake. Somehow this film gives me the same feeling.when I flicked through hundreds of reviews on IMBD, I see that other reviewers are panning it beyond belief. How it is achieving an average score about 7 can only be explained by the number of people giving it an undeserving ""10"".Awaiting more original content rather than remakes. Some classics should simply be left untouched. They could do a bonanza remake of Mary Poppins with unbelievable effects, but redoing a historical masterpiece is unnecessary - as is the case with the Lion King.","

"AdrenalinDragon","19 July 2019","Disney has managed to hit rock bottom by turning arguably their best Disney movie of all-time into one of the biggest pile of garbage I have ever witnessed on the big screen. Imagine all the colour, emotion, life, magic, joy, and personality sucked out all in an instant from one of your all-time favourite movies. That's this 2019 Lion King remake in a nutshell. As the end credits were rolling, I felt nothing. I didn't care about anything. I never felt sad, happy, overjoyed, or any emotion the entire time. I was soulless, just like this entire movie was. It was Disney at their absolute worst. They took the weakest and blandest possible way out of making this movie. If you've watched the 1994 original, you've seen this movie, and anything they added or changed was pointless filler or bad changes that made the movie much, much worse than you could have ever imagined.Why would I want to see lifeless versions of my favourite songs with the dullest visuals and animals doing nothing interesting just so this movie can stay ""Realistic""? I have no idea but someone thought it was a good idea! Was it worth it Jon Favreau? Improving your visuals so much that the goddamn animals can only open their mouths and do nothing else with their movement? Oh right, animals can't emote properly because they can't emote much in real life! Geez, I wonder why in the original Animated version these Animated characters had over-exaggerated features to be like Human beings? Oh right, so we can emotionally connect with them! It doesn't translate very well in ""Live Action""!You can imagine alot of these shot-for-shot sequences being much worse in this ""Live-Action"" CGI remake. Scenes were dumbed down or replaced with crappy alternatives because the CGI animals couldn't do them in the movie or had no emotion to pull it off. In one of the most iconic scenes of the original movie, the audience were laughing at a very serious scene that is played to extreme
dramatic effect because of how dumb it looked in ""Live-Action"". There is nothing funny going on in this scene at all. They turned one of the most emotionally devastating sequences of the original movie into a huge embarrassment. How could you do that? Why do we feel nothing for Simba and these other characters? Why do almost all the voice performances feel like they only used the first take out of so many of these talented actors? Very dull and uninspiring.They butchered the villain Scar big time as well! In the original he was a sly, snarky, sarcastic, and quotable evil Lion with so much personality and wit behind him. In the new one he just sounds like a generic bad guy Lion who is always angry. In fact, I didn't even notice it was Scar at first! They made all the animals look so realistic you can't tell some of them apart until a character mentions them or you connect the dots with their lines taken from the original, which I have to say was very lazy as it was basically like 90% of the same dialogue. Thanks for also butchering one of my favourite characters Rafiki by the way. Even though you guys were basically doing a shot-for-shot remake, you got rid of his best moments for no reason! Timon and Pumbaa now have unfunny jokes constantly and just feel like pale imitations of their originals who were so beloved back then.What about the filler and new stuff? Well, you get one forgettable song sung by Beyoncé in it. It doesn't fit the tone of the movie at all and just felt like Disney had to add some random song in there so they could get the Best Original Song Oscar nomination. Shenzi the Hyena is now the leader of all the Hyenas but it doesn't really go anywhere or develop her character at all. There's a new scene which shows Nala escaping the Pride Lands ruled by Scar that is just padding and adds nothing to the table at all. The Lion Sleeps Tonight gets a bit more screentime but it's just showing off bugs and animals and nothing more.
There's probably more but I've already forgotten alot about this movie. They changed some of the dialogue here and there, and most of the time it's worse jokes or lines that don't feel natural at all. Even stuff like cinematography, music, and line delivery all felt off and unprofessional in large parts of the movie.You know? The more I think about this remake, the more I get angry about it and I wish someone would just snap this piece of trash out of existence. The original was close to perfection already, so why bother remaking this movie? This is the laziest Disney cashgrab I have seen so far, and I'm getting sick of them releasing these ""Live Action"" movies being made over and over again now, but it doesn't matter because Disney is going to make loads of money anyway. This Lion King remake in particular was easily the worst one so far, because all it needed to do was rely on the brand and make the exact same movie again bring absolutely nothing new to win people over. What happened to artistic integrity, originality, or effort? I hate having to think this stupid movie exists with the original now.1/10","

2) Few artists used for voice overs aren't as convincing as the original one had.
3) Few scenes were improvised which ruins and feels rushful while watching the film.I am not huge on live looking CGI as I have enjoyed animation. Sure Disney has pulled off awesome job but not worth it.","

"EasternZZ","28 July 2019","This is Lion King with nice HD graphics. There is maybe one or two new scenes that help flesh out the story, but if you have seen Lion King, you have seen Lion King (2019).The music is still pretty epic, but there is a very weird out of place pop song towards the final 20 minutes that just did not mesh well. Another issue is that ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"" was performed in this movie during the daytime, so the lyrics made no sense at all. People already talked about the facial emotions of the animals and and angry lion, sad lion, or happy lion look the same. I would just prefer them to make it a little bit ""fantasy-like"" and just have these lions emote better with eyes or mouths.This movie kinda ruins some of the classic scenes, like the final battle was cool and a lot longer, but Simba and Scar's final showdown was better in the original. The remake didn't have the awesome slow motion slap that the original had.Lastly they ruined the most classic scene in the Lion King, the ""cloud"" scene. In the original you saw Mufasa's face in the cloud cleary, but in this remake all you see are clouds and lightning, with a very very brief glimpse of Mufasa. It kinda loss the emotional impact.Anyways it is a 6/10 because it is pretty much Lion King with god graphics.","

What's good.. the CG looks very real and at no point in time does it look unreal. You want to believe that the Lions are really talking or moving. It's almost a remake of the original movie scene to scene.. almost. What's bad.. certain scenes in the original movie had a lot of charm.. like Rafiki advising Simba to come back, which I thought was quite tame in the remake. Because the original movie was animated the expressions from the characters added to the emotional scenes which could not be achieved in the remake. Watchable.. but I am still a fan of the original movie.","

"MrDHWong","18 July 2019","The Lion King 2019 is a CGI photorealistic adaptation of the 1994 Disney animated film of the same name. Directed by Jon Favreau (Iron Man, Cowboys & Aliens, The Jungle Book), it is a visually appealing, albeit pointless remake that adds almost nothing new.In the African savannah, Simba (voiced by JD McCrary), a young lion prince, eagerly waits until the day he takes over as king from his father Mufasa (voiced by James Earl Jones). One day, Mufasa is murdered by his jealous younger brother Scar (voiced by Chiwetel Ejiofor), forcing Simba to flee his kingdom or face a similar fate. After covering a great distance, Simba meets a meerkat and warthog duo named Timon and Pumbaa (voiced by Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen respectively), who take him in and teach him their carefree lifestyle. Eventually, Simba learns that he must take responsibility and reclaim his rightful place as king from his wicked uncle.While it does showcase some nice use of colour and cinematography, The Lion King 2019 offers little else worth recommending over its animated counterpart. The story is the same as the original, the songs remain unchanged, and even most of the dialogue is word-for-word identical. At best, director Jon Favreau is merely a conductor of someone else's symphony, a far cry from his work on 2016's The Jungle Book, which took risks and felt refreshingly new. In addition to this, the photorealistic CGI often had the film at a disadvantage as it fails to convey any real emotion from the animals. In the 1994 film, the animal characters were able to look a variety of different emotions due to the artistic freedom of it being animated as a cartoon, whereas in this film, each animal looks stoic whenever they're supposed to be sad or angry. Overall, to the small percentage of those who haven't seen the original, this film may be alright, however, all others should stick with the 1994 classic instead.I rate it 6/10","

"hillman_mcfc","31 July 2019","The Lion King was one of if not my favourite film as a kid so I was always going to have this ""it will never be as good as the original"" but I enjoyed the Jungle Book and Mowgli so I knew the enjoyment factor could still be there. Visually it's stunning Disney look like they have spent an absolute fortune on this and it shows, but a few things with it there is no emotion being shown like 0 you can't tell if they're happy sad angry the only relation you have is with the voice, and that brings me to the sound. You can tell that the voice actors have done this in a studio from the first word spoken I was taken a back with how out of sync it was it just didn't fit. The whole film is almost shot scene for scene with the original which isn't that old at all. Scar's voice just wasn't menacing enough for me he was no Jeremy Irons I can tell you that, everything seemed rush, the scene when Mufasa gets thrown off the cliff by scar when he utters the word ""long live the king"" when Irons done it, it was slow, dark, scary like when the new actor does it, it's literally like they're having a normal conversation. I don't like the beyonce song the score was pretty much the same from the original. 6/10 is being generous from me, I would leave it for blu ray, I don't think the original is that old to justify a remake so soon and if you are going to do it change it up enough to make it worth while.","

"menzoderks","21 July 2019","The original Lion King is one of my favorite movies of all time and if you feel the same I'd recommend you to never watch this remake. Now let me explain how this movie is completely ruined.1. Characters have no facial expressions - So in the original if you just turned off the sound you'd still be able to understand what's going on as the body language and facial expressions were a big part of what brought these characters to life. In the new film simba looks like a real lion and similar to a real lion he has zero facial emotion. This is true for all the characters.2. The voice acting is horrible - everyone talks incredibly unemotional and SLOW. These actors have likely been told in production to do so as otherwise it would have looked weird for these animals to move their mouths so fast. Even Mufasa's voice is far slower and less emotional while it's still the same voice actor. They really talk half the speed and have odd pauses in their dialogue. Emotion is gone entirely.3. Clever jokes and small exchanges are not in this movie - Because characters talk so slowly they can't say as much. Therefore all small jokes and clever exchanges are left out. A few are kept in, but fall flat as the timing is off now. For instance when in the original Simba and Nala go to the elephant graveyard the hyena have all these fun exchanges and they are left out in this movie, Instead we get 2 hyenas that are particularly unfunny...4. The songs are ruined - In the original movie, songs bend real physics and reality to give an expressive montage that was visually stunning. Here they just walk or jog a bit.Then a few other animals might appear, but that's about it. Songs are also played at a slower tempo which in itself ruined all the momentum out of the song.5. Simba is unlikable - Before simba flees away from pride rock you feel his character is a bit reckless and a bit cocky, but he is also brave and has the characteristics of a leader as he protects others. In the elephant graveyard he stands up for Zazu (while he does not even like zazu) saying the hyena's should pick on somebody their own size. When he and nala then have to run for their lives nala is falling behind. Simba then runs back and saves her by scratching Shenzi. These 2 things do not happen in the remake, which make simba a cocky guy only caring about the power he will get as a king. In the second half you'll start to wonder if he really should be king.6. Filler scenes - There are a few additonal scenes or things that are dragged out that give zero character development and do not bring new information at all. You'll notice these scenes in the film, but to give 1 example I'll tell the one that's the least spoilery. Remember that mouse that scar grabs under his hand in the beginning? You see him run up to the camera, wash his nose and BAMN. Scar has him under his paws. In the remake we see this mouse crawl for a whole minute. Why?!? Later in this movie there is something that took the original 5 seconds too, but here takes 2 minutes! They're are really struggling to make the movie 1 hour and 50 minutes, whereas I do not think it's necessary at all and they could have just made a movie of 1 hour and 25 minutes as the original was.This movie has no soul and leaves a bad taste towards the original.Disney has lost all it's credibility and respect it still had left by making this atrocious movie.","

"kevinxirau","9 August 2019","With all the live-action remakes Disney has been making as of late, it seemed inevitable that ""Lion King"" would be given the same treatment. Question is how do you even redo a film beloved by most, the very height of the Disney Renaissance? Jon Favreau took on the task having previously done ""The Jungle Book"", though I'd hesitate to really call this live-action given that it's mostly animation.I'd be lying if I said watching this on the big screen didn't make me feel nostalgic, getting chills when scenes like ""Circle of Life"" and the wildebeest stampede come around. Hans Zimmer's music is still a blast to this day. I also got some laughs out of the new jokes, including references to both the Broadway show and another Disney classic; Timon and Pumba are still pretty funny. The new cast gets credit for their vocal performances with only a few lines that felt off. Certain characters, dialogue, and moments were changed albeit minimally, occasionally to give new contexts or more believable actions such as Scar's plot to take the throne.Apart from one added scene, though, it's still the same movie, which may disappoint those expecting something truly new. Another issue is the crew's insistence on making this realistic led to a problem: most of the animals, despite their vocal inflections, lack facial expressions, making it harder to connect with them in the especially emotional scenes. It's strange given that Favreau allowed the animals in ""The Jungle Book"" a wide range of expressions (heck, actual animals can be expressive from time to time). Some aspects like ""Be Prepared"" and Rafiki aren't as impactful as they did in the original and, while graphically detailed, the visuals don't pop as much, particularly during song sequences where the colors are more muted.""Lion King"" 2019 is a case of what I call giving a classic a new coat of paint. It looks nice, but it's still fundamentally the same thing. This left me conflicted. I still enjoy it, but at the same time I think more could've been done.","

"danchi-75448","20 July 2019","If you have watched the original animated version, thought it was great and than watch this version-there is a unconscious comparison being made in your mind that I think won't allow you to see it from a different perspective and not vet it on it's own merits. I saw it with family members who have watched the original multiple times and they seemed to have some sort of block the minute the film started. One comment was ""I don't like it"" Why? It's too real"". Another, ""It's too big"" things along those lines but no comments of substance as to why they didn't like it. I personally have seen the original several times and I enjoyed both. Plus listening to the voice of the great James Earl Jones is always a plus for me.Don't listen to the critics.","

"SnoopyStyle","11 September 2019","It's the realistic CGI rendering of the 1994 Disney animated classic. I don't love the original but I do respect the Shakespearian jungle book. It hasn't changed for this new version. I still don't like Simba but a little less this time. Instead of a brat, he's more of a clueless kid. Scar's villainy seems less cartoonish and more threatening. It's the heart of the change for the new movie. The CGI rendering is very realistic. The cartoon animation is a memory in the back of the mind. I'm reminded of all the nature films and that's where the trouble begins. While the rendering is correct, these are not real animals. It's jerry-rigging a human story into the animal kingdom. For some reason, it's fine for a cartoon since that's fake. This feels real and yet it's fake. That dichotomy annoys me. So different things annoy me in the two versions of this movie. I still respect the heck out of it although Disney is not adding to the culture by continuously redoing the same movies.","

"harril-586-26745","31 July 2019","CGI is great with beautiful lighting and a very cute baby Simba. Sadly, the music was massively underwhelming with 'phoned in' vocals by 2 of R&B's reputedly finest vocalists Beyoncé and Childish Gambino. And why are the best moments of this PC 'child friendly' version - though spectacular sonically and visually - the most violent parts of the story? All of the poignant and hilarious moments of the original movie have been diluted and in some instances, surgically removed. Are the makers seriously catering to a new generation of kids that will suck up and feast on this modern way of telling stories? I had to see it once but hope to never see it again and look forward to crying and laughing at the original some day soon.","

"msbreviews","19 July 2019","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I don't know how I should start, but I guess I'll address something that people might ask: yes, it's a SPOILER-FREE review. Why? Well, the story might follow the same essential plot points, and the characters might have similar narrative paths, but there are so many details that make this movie stand on its own. From tiny little improvements to moments of the original that wouldn't make sense in a realistic environment to adjustments to character's backstory, musical moments or other significant parts. With that said, I need to discuss the controversy surrounding this remake, but I won't take longer than one paragraph.People need to understand that these Disney's remakes aren't here to replace the originals. They're here to honor them, and bring their stories and characters to this new century so that new generations can have an additional look at something they love, and 90s kids can remember why they love these films so much. Emphasis on the ""additional"" part of that sentence. Then, people also need to get their preferences right: would you want to watch a shot-for-shot remake or something entirely different? Or a blend of these two? If you don't know what you want, you might be in danger of turning into a hypocrite if your speech goes from ""I don't want these copy-paste remakes"" to ""they changed that specific moment, why didn't they keep it the same?"" Just be clear on what you wish. If you simply don't want Disney to do these remakes, then just don't watch them. Don't go online try to beat it to the ground with negative comments if you haven't seen the movie. Moving on ...I love it. I absolutely love it. I cried the exact same 4 times as I did in the 1994's original. My whole body got chills during the opening sequence, which is one of a few things I love more about the remake than in the original. It's NOT a shot-for-shot remake! I don't understand how so many critics are calling it so. Either people's memory of the original faded or someone clearly didn't watch the same film. I can write a whole review of 1000+ words just describing the new stuff. Of course, the story goes through the same iconic moments in the same way, and some dialogues are extensively repeated, which was something that I was hoping they developed more. Despite that, I still feel that the scripts have a different take on it from the voice actors, even James Earl Jones.One proof would be that I cried on a scene that I never felt like it in the original. I don't know if it was how it was shot (one of the various different angles that the remake provides of known scenes) or if the dialogue just has more impact this time around, but the point here is that this remake is NOT a cheap copy-paste. I always look forward to seeing what they come up with to solve or adjust some questions that the originals leave us with. Let me just write that Jeff Nathanson has some truly brilliant changes/additions. Remember people criticizing Scar's look when the first teaser came out? With just ONE WORD, its entire physical shape, scar, and past are explained. One word. Imagine that. There are little elements like adding a word or a sentence here and there, and it makes so much more sense with the character or the story in question.Speaking of Scar, Chiwetel Ejiofor is astonishing. Scar might be my favorite character of the remake. He's more menacing and scarier, his voice is darker, and his arc is better explored. Jeremy Irons will always have that iconic voice associated with the character, but Ejiofor did a crazily good job in replacing him. However, if there's one voice that I could never watch another actor do is Mufasa's. I have no words to express how emotionally powerful James Earl Jones' voice is. As soon as he says ""Simba"" in the reflection scene, my eyes drop waterfalls. His voice is an emotional trigger, let's call it that. I love Timon (Billy Eichner) and Pumbaa (Seth Rogen) even more this time around. Their scenes are hilarious, and the characters' relationship keeps being a standout. Oh, and if you were worried that the hula scene would never be as good let alone surpassed ... You might need to rethink that. Also, I enjoyed the stretched last act (I found the original's final battle too abrupt), and I would advise parents to be careful showing this remake to (very) young kids since the violence on display feels much more real (duh).JD McCrary and Shahadi Wright-Joseph (young Nala) are amazing, and their voices are crystal clear while singing. Donald Glover and Beyoncé (adult Nala) are also terrific, and their voices are even better. The new music Spirit fits better in this remake than Speechless in Aladdin. Moving on to the music, it's another aspect that I genuinely think the remake does better. Hans Zimmer proves that he can bring an old score of his back to life in a much more robust, epic, and passionate way. Every song feels more prominent, every soundtrack feels a lot more impactful and stronger. Be Prepared is the only one that goes through a significant change, and while it might sound a bit strange at first, I love it more each time I listen to it. It's a score that will never be forgotten, and this remake just helped people remember how great it is. Oscar-winning score.I left the best to last: the visuals. I can't possibly describe how impressive and eyegasmic the CGI is. Animals talking was never an issue (people keep sharing GIFs or short clips and immediately started complaining that it looked awkward ... a 30-seconds video without context watched on a laptop will never give you a hint of how the movie will actually be). Yes, the expressiveness of the original animation can't be achieved, but going as far as saying that the film lacks soul or that the characters don't emote is just inaccurate. You don't need a PhD to understand that a lion with its ears down or up means different things. There are tiny little movements in the animals that are so complex that I'm still astounded how they were able to do it. If a bug flies near their faces, they flinch or move in such a characteristic way that I felt like I was truly watching real animals. Once again, Oscar-winning VFX.I don't really have major problems with it. Minor gripes with a few things, but the biggest one would be the lack of more uniqueness. There's no element of surprise in regards to the story or the character's decisions. We always know what's coming, so we're prepared (no pun intended) for anything they through at us because, well, we've seen it before (with the exception of one particular scene that made me jump out of my chair and I think not a single person will be able to avoid it). I find the ""animals don't emote"" argument one of the biggest nitpicks in the history of cinema. It might be true that they lack the emotion of the original animation, but going as far as saying that they show absolutely no emotion is just hating for the sake of hate. Same goes for people criticizing the fact that Can You Feel the Love Tonight is sung during broad daylight ... In the original, it isn't nighttime as well.Finally, I just want to address the ""these remakes aren't necessary / no one asked for these"" discussion. No one asked for the 1994's movie until it came out. People didn't know they needed it. Seriously, everyone needs to realize that these remakes aren't here to replace the originals. How many of you have watched The Lion King (1994) or showed it to someone in the past 10 years? How many times have you heard its score in the same period? I bet that most of the answers are simply ""none"". That's how important this remake is then! It makes you go back, it makes everyone remember how incredible the 1994's film is, by keeping its essence while being able to stand on its own. Jon Favreau did a tremendous job, and I hope he gets recognized for it.In the end, it doesn't matter if the story is identical if we cry all the same. It doesn't matter if we know what's coming if we still feel nervous and worried about the characters. The Lion King (2019) is one of Disney's best remakes so far, on par with The Jungle Book. Its VFX are game-changing, its score is more powerful and emotional than in the original, and the story carries the same heartfelt impact. James Earl Jones' voice is everything. Timon and Pumbaa are even funnier. Ejiofor's Scar is the best character in this remake. I have no flaws to point out, except that it follows the exact same path that the original's story does. I wish it would be more distinct, but I can't lie to myself, I love it deeply. One of 2019's best movies. My #1 spot will be hard to decide... Go watch it! I can't wait to see it again!","

"NBates1","18 July 2019","The Lion King is without a doubt one of the greatest animated films of all time ( if not THE greatest). It was already flawless, and so there was no reason whatsoever to remake it, especially if there is nothing new to be added to the story.
The visuals are breathtaking and unsurpassed, but the very realistic looking animals look rather awkward when they talk and show no emotion whatsoever, something that has been achieved exceptionally in 2D animation.
The voice cast in general is fine, but no one really stands out.
It is the same story exactly, but the magic is not there.","

"theredsky","21 July 2019","What a pathetic, unnecessary, crappy cash grab. Don't get me wrong, I love the original film a lot and I like Jon Faverou but both don't mix well together. Here are the few positives. Obviously the film looks visually impressive but that leads to some problems later. Most of the voice cast does a fine job. Especially Donald Glover, Billy Eichner, Seth Rogen, and John Oliver. That's where the positives end. Here are the negatives. This is essentially a shot for shot remake of the original film. There is almost nothing new except a new song which is played in the background and extended scenes of pointless scenery and a single piece of Simba's hair flying across the desert. I give some credit to the other live action remakes for at least trying to do something different, even if they didn't work but this film does almost nothing new at all. It played it safe which was the wrong direction. Some of the voice acting isn't great. James Earl Jones sounds like he wasn't even trying. It sounds like he recorded all of his lines in one take and then went home. Chiwetel Ejiofor makes Scar seem like a pathetic loser. He just fails to capture that spine tingling and energetic performance of Jeremy Irons. The songs besides Circle of Life and Can You Feel the Love Tonight just are underwhelming especially Be Prepared which for some reason was cut short. The musical score is fine but it feels like they just copy and pasted the score from the original instead of making new renditions of the score. Even if the CGI is impressive, it also serves to the film's detriment. You can't relate to the characters because the visual effects don't allow them to convey any emotion. An example would be Mufasa's death. The actor voicing young Simba does a good job conveying his grief with his voice but Simba literally has a blank stare on his face the entire time. This is a problem throughout the entire film. The animals express almost no emotions. That's the beauty of the animation style of the original. Because it was animated, the animators had free liberty to make the animals express in whatever way they wanted. Another problem would be that some of the more important moments are shorter in this film than the original. The stampede scene was about 5 minutes while in this one it feels shorter which is odd because the film is almost 30 minutes longer than the original. This all begs the question. What was the point of this film? Obviously money but there's no point to the film. It's just the same thing that is somehow almost 30 minutes longer. Overall, The Lion King is visually impressive but fails at recapturing the beauty, scope, and emotional weight of the original animated film. I give The Lion King (2019) a 1/10.","

"bob the moo","16 August 2020","An impressive trailer and a lot of big names drew my eye to this film; the original Lion King is a regular in my house with the children so it is a film I enjoy. This remake is pretty much an update of the original in terms of technology, but the scenes, the dialogue, the songs, all pretty much stay as they were. This direct remake approach means that it invites constant comparison, which is a problem for the remake because it doesn't play kindly for it.Leaving the technology to one side for the moment, almost all aspects of it feel lesser, and I'm not entirely sure why it does. The cast is impressive and if everything else is the same why does it not work as well. Hard to say but the performances and songs are just not as good as the original; the example that sticks with me the most is Ejiofor, who is a great actor but his Scar is not as good as Irons' was in terms of the song or the dialogue. This continues down the line and really the only place that the film does better than the original is how well it portrays peril and danger - not just having it look 'real' although that helps, but just the intensity of the action scenes and the drama around them. Whether or not this is what you want to have been improved in a kids film or not is up to viewers choice, but mine found it a bit much at the end.The technology is impressive in terms of what it can do - the animation looks and moves in a totally realistic fashion and it is easy to think you are watching something 'real'. This is a selling point but ironically it is a big problem too, because it never stops being weird to see these 'real' animals delivering dialogue and singing. With the original this was not an issue because we accepted whatever these drawn characters do, but the realism works against what the film is trying to do, and it tended to distract me and prevent me getting into it. In the end, the conclusion I had to take as to why this film was made, was of course money. Nobody was bemoaning the animation limitations on the original, and nobody was crying out for a carbon copy remake - it was done to generate more revenue from old properties, which was a goal that was achieved.","

"ferguson-6","15 July 2019","Greetings again from the darkness. If you have come here to read yet another take on how this next-gen remake of a beloved film doesn't bring anything new to the story, you've come to the wrong place. I love cinema as an art form, and when analyzing a movie, I typically look for the good and enjoyable, rather than focusing on every element I might be able to criticize ... never forgetting that the on screen presentation is the culmination of work performed by many dedicated people so that I might sit back in a comfy seat within the confines of an air-conditioned theatre and be entertained for a couple of hours. And entertained I was.It only takes a few moments for the awe to set in. The look is at times so realistic that kids may actually believe animals can talk. More than once the fur of an animal or the splash of the river reminded of a National Geographic program with ultra-High Definition photography. So let's clear up something right now. This has been labeled as a ""live action"" remake of the animated classic from 1994. You should know, even if your eyes tell you otherwise, that there is nothing ""live"" in the film. Instead, everything you see on screen is computer-animated/generated. No, the lions and elephants aren't real and neither are the trees or distant mountains. The look of the film is as revolutionary as when the first TOY STORY stunned us in 1995. We had never seen animation like that then, and we've never before seen computer effects like this. What is familiar are two early songs, ""The Circle of Life"" and ""I Just Can't Wait to be King"".Of course, neo-realism can be admired only as a technical achievement when we are discussing a movie in which lions talk and warthogs sing. So while we marvel at the technical achievement, let's not lose sight of the story ... what made the original so popular and beloved 25 years ago. Although it's approximately a half-hour longer than the original, this one is exceedingly close to a scene-for-scene remake. Only minor tweaks will be noticed, mostly in the demeanor of Scar and the banter between Pumbaa and Timon - each actually improving on the first film. What remains is the coming-of-age story that will now touch many new hearts and minds.Kids will be immediately entranced with the cubs, Simba and Nala, voiced by JD McCrary and Shahadi Wright Joseph (the daughter in Jordan Peele's US), and with Zazu (voiced by John Oliver), the goofy and comical bird tasked with keeping an eye on the two adventurous youngsters as they get themselves into trouble. James Earl Jones (now 88 years old) reprises his iconic voice role as the wise Mufasa, and Alfre Woodward voices Sarabi, the pride's leading female. Chiwetel Ejiofor is excellent as the bitter Shakespearian villain Scar, but I couldn't help but wish Jeremy Irons had returned for this interpretation of the jealous and power-hungry brother of Mufasa.The energy level jumps once Simba meets Pumbaa the warthog and Timba the meerkat. Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner take the comedy routine to a new place, and we can only assume much of their banter is off-script. Kids may not get every joke, but they are sure to respond to this odd couple. Donald Glover and Beyonce voice the grown Simba and Nala, and both are outstanding - especially with their singing (no surprise there). Nala's role is expanded a bit ... as expected when you cast Queen Bey. Her original song ""Spirit"" is included but it's her duet with Glover on ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"" that is a real musical standout.Director Jon Favreau has been in the chair for such hits as IRON MAN 2 (2010), IRON MAN (2008), and ELF (2003), and he was also behind Disney's live-action remake of THE JUNGLE BOOK (2016). The writing credits belong to Jeff Nathansan (CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, 2002) for the screenplay, Oscar winner Brenda Chapman (BRAVE, 2012) for the story, and Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts, and Linda Woolverton for the characters. The latter three were among the 28 writers credited for the 1994 version. Also back is composer Hans Zimmer, who won an Oscar for his 1994 score, and songwriters Elton John and Tim Rice, also Oscar winners for their 1994 song, ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"".The beloved 1994 version didn't win the Oscar for Best Animated Feature film because the award didn't exist until 2002; however, it did spawn the 1997 Broadway smash musical. This more realistic version is rightly rated PG rather than G, as some of the scenes are likely to be a bit intense for younger viewers. And it's important to remember that this version is meant to bring Simba's story to a whole new generation - it's not meant to replace the 1994 version for those who were kids when it came out so many years ago. The story and characters, while familiar to those age 30 and up, will be a whole new viewing experience for today's kids. So while we may prefer the 1994 animated version, kids today will likely be enthralled by this updated look. And we all better get used to it, because Disney has 18 more ""live action"" remakes in the works (some of which will actually be ""live"" action).","

There were moments of laughter, for example when the hyena needed personal space, and there were moments where the entire cinema (which included young children) was silent as an emotional scene took place.
Throughout the whole film, I felt connected to the characters, and I genuinely felt the hairs on my arms stand on end when the film reached its climax.

Beyonce????? Really? ANYONE else could've done a better job, and I mean anyone.
Had NO EMOTION what so ever. None.Missed important scenes from the first movie like:
1. Rafiki hitting Simba with the stick saying ""it's in the past"";
2. Smart-funny conversation between hyenas and Simba/Nala/Zazu.
... and many more.I wanted to cry when Mufasa died, but I couldn't because it all happens in 20 seconds and it is FLAT.Also I wanted to cry at the end of the movie because it was horrible.","

"CinemaClown","18 October 2019","An atrociously abhorrent abomination that butchers every little thing that was great about Disney's crowning achievement, this photorealistic remake of The Lion King ranks amongst the worst crimes ever committed on film canvas. Brought to life by the studio whose greed knows no bounds, this unnecessary & unwarranted turd is the latest in Disney's new-found formula for making billions dollars more by simply cashing in on viewers' nostalgia. And if its box-office gross is any indication, it won't be the last.Devoid of heart, soul & creativity that made the original an undisputed masterpiece for all ages, this repugnant reiteration is a vomit-inducing version that sure looks pretty on the surface but is empty from within right down to the bottom. Had they superimposed the original audio recordings over its so-called realistic visuals, the result would still be a bit better than what the new voices, new scenes, new songs & new characters add to the final print. Everything feels off & out of sync about this one. Not a single thing clicks.Now I've got nothing but appreciation for the hardworking visual effects artists, for they just did what they were paid to do. And they did an excellent job at it. But the filmmakers' decision to realistically portray the animals also strips these characters of all the heartfelt emotions & genuine expressions they illustrated so vibrantly in the original. Nothing that happens in this story evokes our feelings or tugs our heart, not even THAT scene. Even the carefree duo of Timon & Pumba come off as annoying & insufferable this time. Also, several dialogues are similar and yet they don't deliver the same impact.Despite the longer runtime, there is a rushed feeling to it. The original characters exhibit no personality while new ones bring nothing fresh to the table. All its attempts at humour fall flat. The modifications in the music & songs department further ruin the viewing experience. And that Spirit song is so misplaced that it's actually facepalm-inducing. All in all, where the original basked in the rich imagery, limitless creativity, magical flair & pure escapism that the medium of animation provides, this visually striking yet emotionally bland & imaginatively bankrupt retelling offers a cinematic ride that can only be summed up as unforgivably cringeworthy.","

"edluczak","24 November 2019","I'm an old school guy. I grew up with hand drawn animation and loved the original Lion King. I was a little hesitant with this remake but not anymore. This is a full CG movie and it will blow you away. It closely follows the original with some small deviations that were necessary and propels it from just a kiddie movie to something incredible. No it doesn't have the cartoon comedy or the cuteness of the original but it honors the heart of the original classic with a modern take using amazing technology. Yes it is still funny, has the same story and music. This remake was simply beautiful from start to finish. Quit trying to compare it to the original animation and enjoy it for what it is, a very well done remake. This is the future of animation, sit back and enjoy it.","

"movieman6-413-929510","17 July 2019","The Lion King is a live-action film version of the 1994 animation film of the same name. The film is directed by Jon Favreau, the director of Chef, Iron Man and he also directed the live-action version of The Jungle Book in 2016.The film is set in the African savannah where a new heir to the throne is born, the young lion Simba (voice of JD McCrary). Simba is the next king of their kingdom after his father Mufasa (voice of James Earl Jones). Simba his uncle Scar (voice of Chiwetel Ejiofor) has lost his place as the future heir to the throne with the birth of Simba. Scar comes with a dark plan to still be king.
When Scar executes his plan, Simba is banned and ends up in unknown territory. In this area Simba meets the carefree duo Timon (voice of Billy Eichner) and Pumbaa (voice of Seth Rogen). Together with these two, Simba grows up with a carefree life. When the now mature Simba (voice of Donald Glover) meets his old girlfriend Nala (voice of Beyoncé Knowles) again, he is confronted with his past. In this way he is faced with the choice to continue his carefree life or to return to his ancient kingdom and to assume his rightful title as king, but for this he must make the mistakes he has made in the past undergo and see to rectify.This new live-action film from Disney is actually not a real live-action film, because all the animals in the film are placed in the film with good CGI. All African places and backgrounds were also placed in the film with a green screen. With the live action of The Jungle Book, Jon Favreau managed to capture the animals and the jungle in a realistic way in 2016, making it seem like you were really in the jungle as a viewer. With this film, Jon Favreau and his technical team have managed to improve the effects. This makes the film look even more realistic than The Jungle Book and looks like a nature documentary about the African savannah with the story of The Lion King.
To keep the film realistic, the animals do not really show their emotions with their posture as they do with the animation. The animals communicate and show their emotions more with their body language and attitudes. So as a viewer you have a lesser emotional bond with the characters compared to the animation. The emotional moments are the same as in the animation, but do not have such an emotional effect as they do in the animation.Because the story of The Lion King animation is actually a perfect story that you do not need to change anything about, they have not really done that with this live action film either. So this new film comes across as familiar if you know the animation version. A few minor adjustments have been made, but these do not change the familiar story. In the live-action filming of other Disney films such as Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast, they managed to adjust the films a bit to give it a different and individual style and also to give it a more modern look. stop.Most of the voice acting is done well in this film, but if you are familiar with the animation it may take some getting used to hearing the famous characters with a different voice in this film. Fortunately, James Earl Jones can be heard as the voice of Mufasa, but just like when he returned as the voice of Darth Vader in the Star Wars spin-off Rogue One, you can hear that he has grown older. The younger actors, who speak to the young versions of the animals, do a bit better work than the older actors, because with the young characters you can still hear a little emotion in their voices. With the older cast you hear the emotions less in their voices, which is probably done to keep it fitting with their emotionless facial posture. Billy Eichner and Seth Rogan do their voice acting in an appropriate and comical way. Seth Rogan's unique smile is also nice when Pumbaa has to laugh in this film.
The singing work is also done well and in an appropriate way by the cast. Beyoncé and Donald Glover are both singers and are suitably cast in the front of this film. Billy Eichner and Seth Rogan do sing in a somewhat lesser way, but this fits in with their characters. Most famous songs from the animation can also be heard in this film, but in a somewhat different way. Artist Pharrell Williams has done his best to bring the music back in a good way in this version of The Lion King. Hans Zimmer is also the composer of the soundtrack for this film, just as he was for the animation. In this way he brings the soundtrack back in a slightly modified, but also in a well-known way in this version.","

But I was incredibly surprised that this work was very interesting and on very high quality done. It almost completely repeats the original story with a slight correction for the ""realism of the film"" VS the ""animation capabilities of the picture"". And Those who justify their low rating by saying that in this film ""there is no such soul"" and so on, just forget about that last thing.

I did like Simba/Danny Glover and Pumba/Seth Rogan was good. Timon was not good, singing not on key? I wonder why they didn't use as many original voices as they could. It's worth watching for the graphics but then watch the original immediately following to erase the disappointment.","

"daniellepwilks","19 July 2019","This is by far and away one of my top movies of all time and definitely a movie that I can say the lines pretty much the whole way through.After thinking about ""what I was disappointed with"", I would say the following:1. The broadway voices of Nathan lane, Ernie sambella and Jeremy irons really added that punch to the characters that you ""don't know that you're missing till it's gone"". Here I feel these characters fall flat with the ""less projecting voices"" and it was very noticeable. Seth Rogan was the best, but still, the missing ""broadway aspect"" these voices carried made the movie fall flat where it just could have been cast better???2. So many of the little humorous exchanges with the hyenas and with rafiki were taken away. Part of the magic of the lion king was in the humor which was lost in this film. They did try and compensate a little, but I feel the laughter was just not there. Whoopi goldberg and cheech Marin were comedians, why was this not explored more to bring new comedians in for the hyenas roles?Without the booming voices and humour, you realize that the movie is lacklustre where you are left with the story and the cinematography only. The cinematography is fantastic and I know this is a super hard movie to live up to the original, but I feel a lot of the magic that make this movie ""a whole package"" was just not there.Did not feel the same about Aladdin remake - another movie that was with huge shoes to fill (duh, robin williams) and the Aladdin remake was absolutely fantastic.","

"tm-sheehan","19 July 2019","My Review -
Lion King 6.5 / 10At the risk of repeating myself and I've said this about the remake of Dumbo ,Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin if a remake of a much beloved and brilliant animation feature doesn't add anything to the original, why make it?
Of course I know the answer, especially from the viewpoint of the 21st Century Disney film Empire they bring in huge box office dollars and that's ok I suppose but I wonder what Walt Disney would have thought?The Walt Disney Studios under Walt always were striving for originality and breakthrough new projects. You only have to look at some of the extra features on Classic Disney DVD's to see how the Animators and technical teams worked expertly and together with Disney to bring something new and exciting to the screen. Unlike Studios today risks were taken like Snow White the first feature length movie cartoon that nearly everyone said would be a financial disaster but that risk saved the Walt Disney Company from bankruptcy.This Lion King remake features photorealistic CGI animals that look like the real thing so basically it's really another animated feature . Many creative and talented people have put together a pretty fair version of the 1994 original even featuring James Earl Jones repeating his original voice over as Mufasa.The problem with this version for me was unlike the fabulous 1997 Broadway musical version directed by Julie Taymar which added great songs ,choreography and gave audiences a brand new version which featured spectacular production numbers and amazing puppetry this new film adds nothing .In fact Director Jon Favreau has made a much darker version and seems to have cut back on the music and the humour. I found many of the scenes too dark visually apart from the beginning and the end it seemed to concentrate on the horrible hyenas and Scar .I might be wrong but I think very young children would be frightened by this Lion King movie , better to watch the original and best.","

But you have to think why this movie was made and why it's such a big deal. There are many young people who've never seen the original lion king. Walt Disney wanted his movies to be redone every 10 years so each generation would have a more updated version of these stories. You don't have to think this movie is amazing or anything. Just don't turn these young people who have never seen the lion king away. This movie isn't just a cash grab remake. This movie is a celebration of the classic movie that still touches our hearts today.","

"Mark_H_Smit","1 April 2020","The new Lion King has a few moments of genius and the best animal animation that I've ever seen. But it is let down by pacing mistakes and sub par orchestration.The images in this movie are so gorgeous and the animal behavior (especially the facial expressions in the lions) so realistic, I hugely enjoyed the movie despite flaws that I feel could have been relatively easily avoided. It seems that this was a work of love for the animators but somehow the whole was off. Great to hear James Earl Jones again. Pumbaa and Timon were great. I loved the new Simba's hair scene. But why rush over the love scene and some other buildup moments that made the original so great.I also feel that Hans Zimmer missed the mark on the score. I find it wonderous how he succeeds in making an orchestra sound like a collection of electronic instruments. It's not super bad necessarily, but it doesn't match the original in warmth and depth. This soundtrack is nowhere near as good as some of Zimmer's other scores.Such a shame. The first-rate (did I say: awesome?) animation and some moments of wonder made this an above-average 8 for me. But with more love this could have so easily become a 9 or 10.","

However I found this new version to be more colourful (real and natural). There were also some new lines contributing to the deeper meaning of the story.I just find real lions and their roar majestic and noble. To me, it was well worth it. My family loved it.

Easy solutions, a film seeming more as sketch of story, all correct but not having a bit of soul, impressive for technology but , unfortunately, its basic virtue remains the suggestion to see, again, the animation. Its sin - the unclear purpose of it. To remind ? To give few roles to good actors ? To propose something cool in its skin but not in its essence ? But, sure, times changed, new tastes, maybe, new expectations.","

As it let the fabulous CG and cinematography sink in, I realised the animals were not emoting as you'd like in an animated film. The film crew decided to go for realism vs showing more expressions. Nonetheless I loved it and the lack of facial expressions prevents me from rewatching the whole movie again expect for few scenes. But they won't stop your kids from rewatching I guess.","

"maidwell-45616","12 October 2019","This post is a direct response to the 1 star reviewers...
First off this is a scene for scene remake of the original 90s movie.. if you wanted something else then you are confused about the difference between remakes and reboots.
Secondly people seemed shocked that Disney are cashing in on their heritage, that's what they've done since (ironically) the original lion king.. do you not remember the truly woeful lion king 3? And all the cash ins since. This is not a new Hollywood concept people.As for the movie itself The CGI is nothing short of jaw-dropping, truly spectacular in every moment of the two hour run time.
Story and script wise it's almost word for word the same as the original (my favourite Disney cartoon).
The criticism about it being emotionless stems in part from the utterly life-like animals not having cartoon faces with over the top facial expressions, they are made to look completely real (except for the talking of course!) I loved seeing ""real"" animals on screen substituting for the now outdated 90s cartoon versions.
Yes there are some casting missteps, in particular Beyonce.. if you like her over-singing style then great but the delivery of her acting lines is incredibly wooden.
Is this movie a masterpiece? No, not even close as it plays it far too safe in copy and pasting the original but It's a faithful remake of a Disney classic using achingly beautiful imagery and that makes it so much better than 1 stars.","

Outside of Timon and Pumba, the cast feels as if they are going through the motions lacking the emotional punch that made the original film so iconic.Looks can be deceiving.

It ruined the Hyenas, it ruined Scar, it Ruined the comedy, it ruined Timon and Pumba.
Yes, this movie is basically a ""scene for scene"" remake of the original, it copies everything directly from the cartoon.
But they took out all the charm and all the humor that the original had, while not adding anything good.
All of the comedic elements of the first one are gone, the hyenas are not fun anymore, they are just cliche genetic villains with no personality.
Same goes for Scar, hes not intimidating or interesting anymore. He sounds tired and old. All of the wit the character had is gone.
The entire movie is like this. They removed all the little fun parts and all the humor and the little details that makes the original so iconic.
Even when timon and pumba try to do humor, it comes as soulless. They end up being annoying instead of charming. Specially pumba. He was very annoying.Sure the cgi might look great, but at what cost? They focused so much in making the animals look so realistic, that they forgot to add a soul to the characters. They forgot to add any of the humor of the original.

"Darwinskid","20 August 2019","What is the point in remaking The Lion King when its still fresh in the minds of most of the population of the world? It's still relevant enough to where merchandise is still being sold and the original movie is played very often on television. What is the point in trying to make it appear photo-realistic when you will not get the same display of emotion that was seen in the original animation? Is Disney really in dire need of the money? They make billions almost every month off of movies, television, digital streaming, physical home media sales, toys, novels, comic books, theme parks, cruise lines, and video games as things already are. I understand that nostalgic value can equate to serious financial success and that there is something that does create a smirk when the magic of the original is recreated in a new way but the thing is the 1994 classic is still fondly remembered and has been seen by most of the youth of today so comparisons to said 1994 classic are going to happen in more ways than one and no matter how good the effects are and how well the performances it is really a near shot-for-shot retelling with nothing new to offer and will have more people re-watching the 2D animation over it. The people I saw it with couldn't help but point out what was missing and the general lack of emotion expressed from the characters, they all got a big laugh from Timon and Pumbaa who I will admit were pretty good but nowhere as charming as the original. The effects of course are great, many times I was surprised it was all computer generated, but as said earlier because they set out for photo realism the characters can only express their emotions to an extent and as such do not do enough justice for the lively voice work. It isn't bad, its just bland.","

"achyutaghosh","22 July 2019","""Nostalgia is a file that removes the rough edges from the good old days""- Doug LarsonFinding joy in nostalgia when it comes to movies is rather easy. The sense of growing up with characters, and having them influence the person that you may have become is such a strong sentiment. These memories cannot be taken away, and that is true for the Lion King remake.The 2019 Lion King version is impressive- the painstaking efforts that have gone into making the visual effects come alive are to be experienced. In 2019, going gaga over visuals effects is pretty much passe, but still The Lion King is downright astounding. The thing is that beyond the visuals, there is little else that it adds to the original, which in my humble opinion, was a seminal movie. The script, music, the voice acting, the traditional animation remains unparalleled till date.Replace traditional animation with modern live motion capture, and the 2019 version is a shot for shot remake of the 1994 original. All the animals assemble as Simba is born, and as he grows up with his best friend Nala, Mufasa explains to him the circle of life. Scar plots with the hyenas to kill Mufasa, and Simba is chased out of the Pride Lands. He meets Pumba and Timon and grows up with them leading a hakuna matata life, till Nala comes to get him back to his rightful place as king. Scar gets his comeuppance and Simba completes the circle of life when his newborn cub is presented to the assembled animals.Had it been a National Geographic special, there would have been no equal- please take that as a compliment, Lion King. However, even with a stellar voice cast with James Earl Jones reprising Mufasa 25 years on along with Donald Glover, Seth Rogen, Beyonce, John Oliver and Chiwetel Ejiofor, Elton John's all-time classic songs, the movie lacks the emotional impact that the original was able to create. Call it corporate greed, lack of creativity and artistry or just plain laziness- nostalgia notwithstanding, it brings nothing new to the table. Director Jon Favreau did a much better job with 2016's The Jungle Book, which, in my mind is one of the best live action remakes ever.But hey, whatever Disney touches these days turns to gold. The Lion King will might make a few billion for sure, and kids will surely enjoy this round too, but Simba's roar is decidedly low this time round.","

I have watched the new version a few times, the artists are amazing, the cgi wonderful, but there is a disconnect. It lacks the soul of the animated version","

"CountVladDracula","19 July 2019","Where do I begin? First there seems to be no passion. No heart. Much like Beauty and The Beast and the Aladdin remake I almost think it's a conscious effort to be subpar so that people will appreciate the originals more.The animals are supposedly photo-realistic but they barely look like they're actually there. At times Simba looks like he's floating. the movements are stiff and wooden.Be Prepared sounds like a 1960s beat poem that is only sung for the last few minutes.Can you feel the Love Tonight is sung in daylight...It's kind of awful.","

"vitoriafnaf","22 July 2019","That's right, the movie lacks emotion. In the original you could see the love that was put into the entire thing, but this one? It clearly was all for the money. I knew that since the moment I saw the trailer, but whatever.
Animation: The sad thing is that, the major flaw in the fact that everything is CGI. The moviments and expressions of the characters are limited due to the realism they're trying to portrait. The original cartoon-ish style permitted the characters to have expressive moviments and expressions, but here, that's just not possible. I feel like they tried to exaggerate some of the characters moviments, but that turned out to give me some uncanny valley vibes. It would be better to make their faces more expressive and sacrifice part of the realism, really. That would feel way better.
And the colors? Oh, they're very realistic! That means boring. They could've played more with those to make the movie feel more alive.
The voice acting is... meh. Some of the voice acting was good, but the rest was forgettable. Especially the singing by Beyoncé. It just felt off-putting.
But what I want to say in the end is that, this movie is forgettable.","

I'm truely grateful that I'm living in this era to be able to watch such an amazing remake of the cartoon. The music was phenomenal. Beyoncé really brought Nala to live but the show stealers were Timon and Pumba. Go watch this movie with an open mind.

"IPyaarCinema","9 February 2021","Review By Kamal KThe Lion King wasn't really one of my favorite movies growing up, but I enjoyed it as a kid and you can't deny the great animation and great voice acting that still holds up. It's definitely a movie millions remember fondly of, and appreciate till this day.The 2019 remake of The Lion King however, doesn't carry the magic the original had. I must admit the obvious, and say that the visuals are spectacular. All the animals throughout the film look amazingly detailed and will definitely amaze everyone watching it, but the visuals are also one of this film's flaws. Unlike the animated classic, Simba, Mufasa, Scar, and Nala are now real-life lions that fail to show any emotion... because they're real-life lions, and lions don't exactly tend to show any emotion at all really.The voice acting has it's ups and downs, the voice actors for Cub Simba, Mufasa, Zazu, Timon, and Pumba really steal the show. But other's like Older Simba, Nala, Scar, Rafiki are just kinda...there, and only serve to sing covers for the originals already great soundtrack. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar really tries his best and I appreciate his efforts, but his representation of Scar doesn't come close to Jeremy Irons. I don't blame him for this, since it's most likely that he had to work with the original film's script.This movie is great...if you want to watch something you've already seen before that is. The digital artists have done some amazing work here but it feels like it lacks the emotion and soul of the original animation. The sound track is okay with Beyonce shining as you'd expect but again you've heard the songs before, you've felt the emotions and you know what to expect throughout. If you want to watch a shot for shot remake of an already amazing movie, or you've lived under a rock and never seen the original then this is the movie for you. Unfortunately it doesn't do enough to stand out from the original, to which it will always be compared, and there's a feeling the studio just played this one that bit to safe.If Disney start to worry a little more for making new movies than remaking its old successes only With the purpose of making tons of money I will consider to have a little more appreciation for this greedy company, I am starting to think that disney is Like the villian of the movie.Honestly whatever you rated the first movie rate this one the same minus one. Ultimately it is bland and boring with a lot of the humour taken out of it, still no acknowledgement as far as I noticed to Hamlet or Kimba. The American actors, save for Jones who is Mufasa and Glover who did well with what was there, were the weakest part, Eichner especially. The non-Americans outshined their counterparts and gave their characters depth even though they had so few lines. Ultimately the movie is underwhelming, and I would have liked to have seen more African born actors playing roles rather than singers with limited range.It's strange to see the hyper realistic CGI of lion king, as far as content. The animation for the movie is astonishing, although making it as real as possible loses its emotional touch. And that's what makes the movie flat. The emotional moments are usually the most gripping moments but because of the hyper realism they're just THERE in the moment. You don't see the emotions displayed thru the characters......Other than that, the film's story and music are phenomenal, but the original Lion King had already made those.........This movie is very difficult to believe because it is not very realistic. If you're looking for great visuals, this is your movieOkyish movie!! watchable once","

"phoenixnethermoor","2 January 2020","The Lion King.... oof. The Lion King original was fantastic, a musical that had decent music, animation that was outstanding, drama, betrayal, romance and the greatest characters Disney have ever made! But the new Lion King is a word for word remake, different actors making the acting worse, CGI making it feel like we are in a computer (which is good) and the same action as the original. It's just that the original was so perfect that nobody wanted this to happen. But it was okay. If you have seen the original Lion King you know the action that is about to go down, and you are just waiting for the CGI. But those who haven't are waiting for a brand new story. There is mild threat and child's strong language but those aren't worrying. The only thing that is worrying is the acting. 8/10.","

The graphics are really nice. The acting, not so much. Nala and Simba were played better by the kid actors than Beyonce and Danny Glover (they're truly terrible, Beyonce particularly so). Rafiki, Timon and Pumba seem to fade to background characters in the remake. Scar isn't nearly as scary and ""cool"" and all the music sequences aren't as dramatic visually, I get it's not a cartoon but it doesn't need to be realistic, I mean there's talking animals sooo....","

"dmbelafan","4 August 2019","TLK is one of my favorite Disney classics, so while I didn't understand the need for a remake, I did look forward to seeing it with the full theatrical experience again. Boy was I wrong.The core failure of the movie is the inexplicable choice to go fully photo-realistic with the animation. There is zero, and I can't stress this enough, ZERO expression or emotion in the characters' faces. Sure, it's zoologically accurate, but why does that matter when your plot is a conniving lion plotting a political coup with another species?The voice acting was.....barely passable. Nothing remarkable, especially given the A-list names on the cast. Timon and Pumba were the high flyers here, and even they were a pale shade of the excellent originals. Classic musical numbers were either underwhelming or over-performed (looking at you, Beyoncé).All of this is made even more obvious by the fact that the movie is nearly a shot-for-shot, line-for-line copy of the original. Timon and Pumba had some clever self-aware lines that poked fun at that fact, but given how closely they mimicked the original, it's remarkable that the final product managed to come out so flat in comparison.I don't know what this means for Disney's other forthcoming live action re-releases. Aladdin wasn't up to snuff either, but had the energy and character to make up some lost ground. I've not yet seen the Dumbo remake, and want to look forward to Mulan, but if this is where they're setting the bar, I'll wait until they come to Netflix.","

"bobbyd61074","31 August 2019","Not only was this an outstanding movie, it's an experience. Seeing it is truly believing it. You will be wondering if certain scenes are CGI or did they use real animals? The script is true to the original (as far as I can remember) but the visuals are unparalleled.My only complaints were the casting. Sorry guys....Beyoncé is a generational talent but that talent ain't acting. Her performance felt wooden. Like it was being read not performed. And I get that Danny Glover seems to be the flavor of the month but he too seemed disinterested with the role. I'd have preferred two nobodies who were gifted voice actors. Let's be honest. NOBODY should see this because Beyoncé or Glover are in it. I'm not even an Elton John fan but when movie's signature song plays I couldn't help but feel let down with Beyoncé's lesser rendition. That said, at no time did this ruin the film.My son was not happy when he learned he was seeing this movie. He never connected with the original but he along with myself and wife loved this one. Great family entertainment.I hope those writing/reading these reviews keep in mind that this is a child's movie and in my opinion the ideal kind. One where the parents are entertained as well. If you're a non-parent and reviewing this and think it was bad or not as good as the animated original ....do me a favor...come back in ten or fifteen years and update your review. Bet when you watch it with your little one you'll understand the greatness of the movie. Appreciating the significance of the movie's message which every parent experiences as they face their mortality, while praying they've prepared their children to take the reigns in our own circle of life. It definitely had a powerful effect on me. Not sure I'd make that claim if I didn't see this with my son.We are all Mufasa. We are all Simba. And we all know and battled a Scar. I suspect your opinion of the movie will coincide with your current placement within the circle of life. Happy Viewing","

Ok now for some personal notes, i do not have kids and i do not think i saw the first Lion King since when it first came out, and i was not even thinking to watch this one as its a kids movie. So i had no expectations as i was never going to see it anyway.

"grantpaulsen","19 July 2019","I left the theatre with one thought in my head, ""why?"" I fail to see why this was remade other than for money, because there is no sort personality or style of its own, and this remake doesn't offer any new kind of spin on this story, it's basically a shot for shot remake of a film that's already a classic. Why would I ever choose to watch this over the original? It's basically the same movie just without the personality and style of the original. With the photorealistic animals, you can't sympathize with any of them because they don't have any kind of expression, and therefore they can't express emotion. This just goes to show that there was a reason the film was animated in the first place. Also the original was a film that Disney didn't want to make at first, the artists were so passionate about this story that they started to make it anyways out of their own garage and no support from a studio, and yet they still crafted the greatest Disney film of all time. And now that same studio is using their story and milking it for money, because they know how popular it is, which is kind of slimey in my opinion. I can't give it a 0.5/5 because the visuals are spectacular, but none of the changes made to this film were for the better, and nothing of their own was added really. The only difference between this film and the original is that some scenes were shortened and some were drawn out, and all those scenes were terribly executed. So I ask again, when you're remaking something that you know you can't improve, and something that you're not going to change or add your own spin on, then why? Why remake it? It's already a classic, you're just redoing what is already perfect, but you're doing it without the passion, personality, and perfect execution. So, the only reason I can think of is, money.","

"Special-K88","30 July 2019","Not so much a live-action remake, but more of a photorealistic, CGI makeover of the animated feature about a lion cub born into royalty. Simba, the only son of King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi, lives peacefully in the Pride Lands but is a bit too eager to prove his courage and ability to rule. Unfortunately for Simba his embittered Uncle Scar won't genuflect, and will stop at nothing to take the throne. If you're capable of viewing this as a stand-alone feature (which isn't easy) then you can probably find some things to like about it...but--and it's simply unavoidable no matter how hard you try--when comparing it to the 1994 original it lacks the thrill, humor, and sheer emotional punch, despite some impressive visuals and a colorful assortment of vocal talents, including Jones whose reprise provides some much needed authority, along with Rogen and Eichner who seem perfectly cast. Unfortunately the spoken lines don't mesh well with the use of ""live"" animals, and the music doesn't resonate as well as it should. Despite any homages, in-jokes, or straight up replicas from the original film, the magic just isn't there; much of the time it feels like watching a leaden Animal Planet documentary. **","

"bob-the-movie-man","2 August 2019","After Dumbo earlier this year, now here is The Lion King: the live-action version of the prize coronation mug sitting on Disney's shelf of trinkets.I mentioned in my review of ""Toy Story 4"" that in comparing it with TS1, it ably demonstrated that Moore's Law of computing power must still be at least holding reasonably true. Here is another case in point. Technically, this is nothing short of astonishing. It's almost impossible to believe that what you are seeing is computer animated. Every mouse, lion and cheetah so vibrantly and perfectly visualised. That first sight of Simba draws an audible ""Awwww"" from the audience.The pièce de résistance of the film is the first 4 minutes, reproducing with ""live"" animals the ""tribute scene"" to the young Simba. It's visually and aurally gorgeous in every way, and worth seeing the film for in its own right.In ""Dumbo"", an OBVIOUS error is that ONLY mice and crows can talk to elephants - not humans! So here, it is distinctly unsettling that 'real life' animals can speak and sing. It's also inevitable that the animation of eyes and mouth, present in the original version, saps the scenes somewhat of emotion.I'd heard this mantra repeatedly in the critic reviews I'd seen, so was honestly bracing myself for the worst. In reality, it had less of an impact than I was expecting it to, and although never moved to tears at any point, the scenes that were supposed to be moving... were.As with the recent ""Aladdin"" remake, I found many of the songs distinctly underwhelming. ""I just can't wait to be king"" lacked the energy and verve of the original, and Chiwetel Ejiofor went the ""full Rex Harrison"" on ""Be Prepared"". So much so that the term ""song"" might be a misnomer.Above all ""Can you Feel the Love Tonight?"" was one of Elton John and Tim Rice's most beautiful songs from the original soundtrack. Yet, although not savaged by Donald Glover and Beyoncé (playing Simba and Nala), they at the very least give it a good mauling.The score by Hans Zimmer is lusciously produced. There is a new song added as ""Best-Song"" fodder for the upcoming Oscar nominations. This is ""Spirit"" by Beyoncé, although it failed to stir mine in any way. But the best new song on the soundtrack for me was Elton John's offering - ""Never Too Late"" - during the end titles. Complete with African instruments and vocals, it is both cracking and very stirring.As indeed happened in the original movie, the introduction of Timon and Pumbaa adds some much needed energy and humour. Played by Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen respectively, director Jon Favreau encouraged the pair to ad lib many of their scenes. And it shows. There's a lot more fun to be had in there than all Will Smith's genie scenes in ""Aladdin"". In particular, the famous ""breaking the fourth wall"" moment in ""Hakuna Matata"" I found priceless, and made me howl with laughter.Elsewhere vocally, James Earl Jones is back as Mufasa and in so doing makes you concious that there is noone in the world who could perform that role better. The best performance of the rest of the cast, for me, came from ""Black Panther's"" Florence Kasumba as the leader of the hyena pack, Shenzi. She venomously spits her lines our quite wonderfully.TV pundit John Oliver is an interesting choice as Zazu, but didn't nail it for me. I personally missed Rowan Atkinson in that part. Likewise, comparison between Chiwetel Ejiofor and Jeremy Irons as Scar is hardly fair. I'd rate Irons as one of the top 5 vocal performances of any Disney film of all time.For me, the word that keeps floating to the top of these live action remakes is ""pointless"". Why try, other than to fill Disney coffers? (Which I guess is the producer's point!) And my opinion hasn't changed after this. I still think its a rather pointless exercise, particularly in this case where there is no human cast.With these things, I always think of Jim Carrey's cry at the end of his version of ""I am the Walrus"". He screams ""There, I did it. I defiled a timeless piece of art"". Jon Favreau can at least sleep happy (sic) in his bed content that he hasn't managed to do that. I can't say I was horrified by this one, because I wasn't. It was majestic, entertaining, technically superb and certainly had its moments.The acid test for me would be ""would I go and see that again"". And in this case the answer would be ""yes"".(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies via Google or Facebook. Thanks.)","

"theromanempire-1","5 August 2019","Here is the thing about Disney. to make more $$$ they decided to make live action remakes to their classic animation films.
now that's a brilliant idea if we talking about films like.....snowhite, maleficent, alladin, cinderella etc..etc......but not such a good idea if we talk about LION KING.
and the reason is we had an animation film...we have again a new animation remake. not a real live action film in the sense we have no real actors like we do with cinderella and the rest of the live action films.
that's cause we are dealing with animals this time so what's the need for A Useless remake ?
combined with the fact the original and best film and even it's sequel were far better than this remake in all aspects then if u need to watch lion king watch the earlier animation films again and ignore this useless remake which don't even have half the heart the originals had.
soundtrack was also bad compared to the 1994 score.Grade // C+","

"ChristianLeFeuvre","20 July 2019","As I have mentioned before, Disney's 'live-action' adaptations of their classic animated movies have been disasters, and most certainly, not necessary, 'The Jungle Book' was horrendous, 'Aladdin' was ridiculous, 'Dumbo' was worse, and the less said about the reworking of 'Pete's Dragon' the better! However, to give it it's dues, the adaptation of 'Beauty And The Beast' was actually not too bad.
Well, Disney has done it again!
The original 'The Lion King', released in 1994, is easily one of Disney's greatest animated movies and yet they decide to completely waste millions on a completely unnecessary remake and......well there is so much to say about this.
Jon Favreau is the director of this version, he was also the director for 'The Jungle Book' live-action remake. I can't understand how they can call this a 'live-action' adaptation, as every scene and every animal in the movie is created via CGI, surely another version of 'animation',......so they have just remade another animated version of 'The Lion King? Well, yes technically.
Ok, let me say this about it first, as far as visuals go, it is seriously impressive. It does look so realistic and praise goes to the digital artists responsible for the look of the movie. The vocal casting was alright but no way as good as the original casting, I for one missed Nathan Lane and Whoopi Goldberg as 'Timon' and 'Shanzi' respectively, but James Earl Jones is back as the voice of Mufasa.
I would say that James Earl Jones' voice reminded me of the original but everything did! It's the same movie! And before you say 'of course it's the same, it's a remake of the original', it is more than a remake, it is shot for shot the same. Kids who have never seen the original will probably like this version.
The power of the opening 'Circle Of Life' scene is now lost cause it's been done already, the musical score no longer has an impact cause we've heard it before, the emotion of Mufasa's death is lost because we've seen it before, the characters were no longer funny cause we've seen them all before.
There are no surprises here, there's very little that's new, and what is new is so completely unnecessary and well, annoying. The 'Be Prepared' song is heavily shortened, there's a new song added, for absolutely no reason as far as I could see, the scene featuring the 'Can You Feel The Love Tonight' song was, in the original set at night, hence the title of the song, in this remake it's set during the daytime so the song title no longer makes any sense and some scenes from the original have been removed.
What annoyed me about this movie besides the changes, we all know how I feel about change, is that all the personality from the original is non-existent. This movie is soul-less, so much of the humour and mysticism of the original has been completely removed and replaced with an overly serious attempt to make an epic movie and it does not work.
With hand-drawn animation you can create emotion in the faces of the characters, in this that has disappeared and especially in the scene of the stampede and Simba screaming 'Nooo', it just looks like a cub opening its mouth, there is no emotion in the eyes that we saw in the original.
Jon Favreau did great work directing films like 'Iron Man' and 'Elf', but here he hasn't even attempted to make it his version, he has copied original directors Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff shot for shot. I remember when Gus Van Sant remade 'Psycho' in 1998 and it was a shot for shot remake of the Hitchcock classic and I watched thinking 'why?', the original 'Psycho' was already a classic, it was already magnificent, everybody loved it, so what is the point if you are not going to put your own spin or vision into it. Same goes for this remake, WHY???? What is the point?.................oh yes, of course, money! It is basically a cash grab.
I will always love the original. I will always want to watch the original over this. I know that there will be people out there that will adore this movie, who will want to see it to see what it offers, the same movie but with a different look and more realistic characters, and if that's all you want from it, if that's all you're looking for then you will enjoy it, as I said before, the visuals are seriously incredible, but if you are a fan of the original and are planning to see this for a new spin on it or for something fresh or unique then you are going to be very disappointed.
However, there is also the argument that if Jon Favreau had done a new version, a reworking that changed everything then there would be a mass outcry of 'Oh my god, you have ruined The Lion King for me, what have you done?', so it brings me round again to, 'What's the point?' It should never have been done!
I would recommend waiting for this to come out on TV or Sky etc, don't waste your money at the cinema. Or better still, please just stick to the original.
I also understand that there are more 'live-action' remakes in the works, 'The Little Mermaid' is apparently the next one and I can see them destroying that one too.
Disney, please please please STOP this, you are ruining so many classic animated movies just for money.","

I spoke to them about this movie when they started asking questions about it, I saw the original so many god damn times as a kid myself it was ridiculous. They got excited knowing they were going to see something their Dad saw himself as a kid. They enjoyed this film because they're none the wiser, they didn't grow up with the original like I did.I'm not a fan of remakes never have been and never will be, they always suck and this ones no exception... animations good and looks very polished, but again it's just the same movie we already know and love, so why remake a perfectly good movie? why fix what isn't broken? the answer is simple... Disney... there you go, there's your answer. Even the voice acting is what i can only describe as half assed, but then again i'd expect nothing less from someone like Seth Rogan doing a Disney film.I'm so fed up with Disney, Marvel, DC Comics. all their movies are designed to be is just giant cash grabs. Their movies never live up to the hype they generate for that simple reason, especially when it boils down to all these lame superhero movies that are so forgettable you even forget that you saw them in the theater.... it's just about the money now and this is why the film industry sucks so badly these days.Where's Officer Barbrady when you need him.....

"dajanizeid","17 July 2019","I mean, this isn't supposed to be a new movie, it's a remaster. I don't get why people are complaining that it's identical to the original. That's a given you should have accepted before you watched it.As for the animation, yes. I agree. I preferred the old animation style, I found it more appealing, colourful, and expressive. But that doesn't warrant everyone calling Disney cash grabbers. I went into the theatre expecting a remaster and that's what I got.In the end of the day, I really enjoyed watching this movie. It was very nostalgic and there were many goosebump moments. I appreciate the animators over at Disney trying to make this thing as spectacular as they could, regardless of which animation style I prefer.You guys need to stop being so closed minded and negative.","

"clairereid-67845","24 October 2019","I finally got to watch this movie and after seeing the reviews I wanted to share mine. First, it's beautiful. I love seeing the animals like this, but I absolutely love the landscape more. Second, I love Donald Glover and I think he did a great job as Simba. Same for Seth Rogen, John Oliver and Billy Eisner. Okay, I did not care for Beyonce. She just doesn't have a great acting range. She lacks emotion, but she doesn't carry this movie so I don't mind. I needed a little more sass from Scar too! The songs weren't exactly the same but I didn't mind. Disney has been repackaging their movies to make money and you can bet your rear they'll do it again with Lion King in another 25 years. They play on out nostalgia and we're suckers because the ""original"" was so good.","

"mm-39","10 August 2019","Not bad! The Lion King had a good story and pace. The Lion King had family deception, character development mixed in with a story about life. There was some P C headlines (attention grabbing stuff) about racism etc but the movie was tame. I guess the vegan, nature crowd would disagree the nature story about natures order and the food chain. My grand dad who was a game warded would find the story a good education about nature for the kids. Especially the over use part. The story about a boy Lion growing up and finding out the he will become the lion king is a good retelling of home away from home finding home again story. I miss the old school cartoons, but the C G I was okay. The beautiful C G I created great Disney magic. The father son segment was magic. The action ending of good vs evil would be exciting for any kid. 7 stars.","

"silverpinkcity","20 November 2022","What's with the weird anger in some of these reviews? Are people mad that this installment of The Lion King is just a little different from the original? Well, duh...I think that was the point!I finally got around to watching this movie and really enjoyed it. So much work went into creating these images...you can see all the little details of the animals and the expressions...amazing.My husband was a little annoyed (not FURIOUS, mind you...just a little annoyed) that a few of the original funny lines and the ""squished banana"" song were left out. But overall, this movie held my attention, and the basic premise and emotion from the original was definitely intact.Some of the animals were just so adorable (like the little bush baby)! Plus, a lot of the humor was indeed included...so I have no real complaints. People are complaining about the singing...big deal. You need to take the movie as a ""whole,"" and as a ""whole"" it's quite pleasant to watch. I would recommend this movie to people of all ages!","

"georgewilliamnoble","1 August 2019","I saw The Lion King remake this afternoon at my local cineplex in this long summer of disappointing films, this title i was confident would be ace or at least i hoped it would be. Alas, the remake or should i say clone just felt stale, flat, and lifeless. OK it looks amazing in its immersive VR universe, but the Lions in particular came over as very wooden actors. The music sort of saves it, i say sort of because all the musical numbers are inferior to the 1994 original, i did however get the feeling that my audience that I shared the film with were on side with it, as there was very little restless rustling from the mostly young audience, so i guess that i have to assume that the new Lion King is at least a competent flick, but sadly no more. So I am of to my film cupboard to spin the original one more time!","

"getpablo-80944","26 July 2019","As expected, the movie opens with possibly, IMO, the greatest opening scene EVER in the history of movies. The song, the scale, it's all pretty close to the original, even if one or two notes are deliberately sung differently.Visually, the movie looks great. I wouldn't go as far to say it looks incredible, but it does look pretty good. But that's about it. Like so many people, I have seen the original so many times, I can almost recite every line word for word. And that's where the problem starts. A lot of the wisecracks and humor has been discarded with, for no apparent reason.So many of my favourite one-liners and jokes have been replaced with bland, instantly forgettable lines. Beyonce just overdoes all her lines, and the new song they slotted in, Spirit, was just flat and pointless, even in its two minutes of existence.For anyone who hasn't seen the original (and I realised there were actually quite a few of those in the audience with me), it might just be an average movie. For those of us who grew up with it over the past 25 years, it is a disappointing, flat, soul-less money grab by Disney and they should be ashamed of it. But of course, they aren't. It's all about the money, and not the heart, even though that's what Disney used to claim all those years back.The recent Jungle Book, which came out a couple of years ago, was much better than this movie in every aspect. Such a sad indication of what Disney has become.","

Flat vocal acting, no emotional peaks, different score, changed script , all add up to one dull prolonged joyless film.Unlike the original, casting & script was more about current politics like virtually every film. No Quality vocal acting. CGI of lions is bad- their fur looks electrified, not sleek.Lions like all mammals do have facial expressions esp in EYES. Besides, this is CGI - one expects artistic license- not docu. In wild , all lions & cubs DO show emotions from crying, getting misty eyed, to joy, love, family bonding, fear & anger. EYES & eyebrows display expressions, incl whole body. They smile when content & happy.Here , Scar has freakish body, flat vocals. No one can beat J Irons ""Scar"" performance like most of the main characters. Even the new ""Circle Of Life"" score lacks same vocal quality .Clearly animators & director never watched any wild lion docu where lions show variety of facial expressions & body language when relaxed, scouting, hunting, playing, grief, danger, or during pride conflicts.Skip this & watch original. Ruins iconic film; poor vocal casting & cgi; dull from start to end.","

"WooderIce64","22 July 2019","The Lion King is possibly the crown jewel of Disney animation, being considered one of, if not the, best in the Disney lineup, and also making nearly $1 billion in 1994, which was unheard of at the time. Given that the remakes have been extremely profitable, having Lion King come up was inevitable. Unlike the others, though, this is practically a shot-by-shot remake of the 1994 movie. The only changes are very slight, with very little being added. Therefore, the story and characters aren't changed at all to any extent. While it's true that there's very little in the way of originality, it's still a great story and these are still the great characters we know and love. After all, the original isn't beloved for no reason.This movie has one major saving grace: it is also easily one of the most visually impressive movies of all time. It's up there with the likes of Avatar and Life of Pi. The levels of realism put into everything in this movie - the animals, the beautiful landscapes, the plants, everything about it is incredible. The downside is that CGI animals, while they do look fantastic, do not connect to the human audience the way the animated characters do. Take Mufasa's death for instance. In the 1994 movie, it's one of the all-time saddest movie deaths. Here, the emotional impact is largely drained because these lions don't emote the way humans do. That, and we all see it coming. It's partially made up for with the talented voice cast, but it's not enough to save it.The cast is full of all-stars. Donald Glover is Simba, Beyonce is Nala, and James Earl Jones returns to play Mufasa, which is awesome. The songs are there, for the most part. Circle of Life is great as always, Can You Feel the Love Tonight and Hakuna Matata are classics, and I Just Can't Wait to be King was reinvented, taking out the stuff that only works in a cartoon. Be Prepared got nerfed, which sucks because that song's awesome. There's a new one called Spirit. After all, you don't hire Beyonce just to give her one song, right? Additionally, Hans Zimmer's score, kept from the original, is severely underrated.Lion King is a movie that I'm glad I saw in theaters, if only for the visual effects. If it doesn't win the Oscar for visual effects, that's a disappointment. I wish I had seen it in IMAX or something like that. Aside from that, it's just the same story we've known and loved for the last 25 years. And, I must admit, having been born in the late 90's, it was pretty cool to see that opening shot on the big screen. After all, these movies are made for 90's and 00's kids as much as today's kids.","

Throughout the entire moving laughter was heard whenever Pumba and Timon appeared sometimes even out of nowhere! Especially the allusion to Be Our Guest that was spot on.
The live action film met everyone of my standards which are potentially set at a relative high, the graphics were impeccable and you could tell everyone was simply in awe at how realistic every detail was. From the galloping gazelles to the rift of hair that flew off Simba's mane, this is an astonishing masterpiece.","

"jpachar82","1 October 2019","It has been 25 years since the animated version of this Walt Disney classic. No one would have thought or imagined that you could even that anything like this could ever happen. The Circle of Life is something that is not only special but is the heart and soul of every believer that watches something so spectacular that your jaw just drops, or your heart just melts because of the music and the scenery. But it all comes down to 2 words: Hakuna Matata.
Jon Favreau did, not just an amazing job, but an incredible job, reimaging the beauty of what was done 25 years ago in that little-known movie called The Lion King. With an all-star cast that was beautifully casted and crafted - from Donald Glover to the ever-funny man Seth Rogen to the conniving and evil Chiwetel Ejiofor to the beautifully talented Queen of R&B and Hip-Hop Beyoncé - I could go on, but I will stop there.
I loved everything about this movie and the soundtrack is to die for. From the original songs to new songs that we will come to love, both movie and soundtrack will go down in Disney history as the biggest blockbuster of the last century.","

And that's the worst thing a movie could be, boring.I was never a fan of these live-action remakes, and this is easily the worst one out of all of them, Dumbo being a close second. As bad as the remake to Beauty and The Beast was, at least it was colorful and vibrant. This was just dull, dreary, and not at all creative or interesting.Even when viewing it as its own thing, it's dull and uninteresting. At the end of the day, it's just one big waste of time.","

"JorgeLMC","10 December 2019","Better than some reviews have made me think ... unlike other live-action adaptations with Disney's classic label, ""The Lion King"" seems to me to really add something to the original animation experience. The cruder, more realistic look turbines positive aspects of the animation, such as the tragic and poetic content of his narrative, which closely resembles Shakespeare's works.
The so-called ""lack of expressiveness"" so badly evaluated by the public and critics, from another perspective, contributes decisively to what seems to be the primordial proposal of this production: to bring to the real world this fable so true in its ability to reflect about the meaning (or cycle) of life.","

"nintendo-60208","2 August 2019","First off, I want to say that the original Lion King was an absolute masterpiece. Some of the most interesting animated films Disney has ever made. Even up to this day, this film is still considered to be a classic, which begs the question, why does this reboot exist?The Lion King reboot is nothing but a tired, lazy film that totally misses everything that made the original so enjoyable. Let me start by saying that the visuals in this film are really good. The Cgi was so good that all the animals looked like they were actually there. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the rest of the movie.While the cgi does look great, none of the characters express any emotion. They all just have that blank stare on their faces. A perfect example would be Mufasa's death. No emotion what so ever. Most of the songs in this film is like the original, but what disappointed me was the ""Be Prepared"" song. I don't know why they shorten it.Now the acting. I'm glad James Earl Jones reprised his role as Mufasa, but he just sound tired with the script. Donald Glover as Adult Simba wasn't too bad. Timon and Pumba are the highlight of this movie. Whenever they were on screen, the put a smile on my face. Now Nala. Oh boy. Beyonce was a poor casting choice for Nala. I just didn't find her convincing like the original.As for the dialogue, most of it is just word for word from the original, which makes the film lackluster. It doesn't try to make anything new. At least the Aladdin reboot tried to follow the story while offering something new.Overall, the movie is visually good, but the script was lazy, the characters are unexpressive, and the voice acting is mostly tired. So my final score for this is a six out of ten. It's best to just stick with the original instead.","

"sineasta","20 July 2019","This is an example of If ""it ain't broke, don't fix it."" The remake of a beloved classic fails to evoke the magic of Disney. It is staged, with exaggerated personification and anthropomorphism which is a deterrent rather than an asset to the film. The one redeeming quality is using Seth Rogen as the voice for Pumba. His performance brings about the only laughs in a very long and rather boring film. If you want to engage your children's fantasy and awe with the Lion King, show them the original, and spare yourself the agony of sitting through a bad remake.","

(Even if this movie is all in computer graphic, it can be considered part of the last live-action Disney works, for its photographic fidelity and for the historical moment of its creation). I think that's just a way to earn money using things that the audience already know, love and often associate to his childhood. But the enormous production behind this works (we are still talking about Disney) makes the movie interesting for the eyes. This, in reality, is maybe its only (huge) advantage; for the rest it repeats the original plot and also loses characters vivacity. A good movie for eyes, almost useless for the rest.","

Summary; Betrayal - Tragedy - Drama - Exile - Friendship - Growing up - Conflict - Becoming the rightful heir.Very effective 3D, this mode has really been exploited, worth the uplift fee.

"TheVictoriousV","18 July 2019","It seems I am impossible to please, doesn't it? When you take a Disney movie and remake it into edgy fanfic with a ""modernized"" girl-power theme á la Maleficent, I complain that you made needless modifications to the fairy tale. When you follow the original beat-for-beat, I complain that it's so similar that it takes the pointlessness of the ""remake"" to new heights. Why can't I ever be happy?Well, it's because you've yet to see the point: you shouldn't be doing ANY of this, to ANY already existing film version of something (provided you don't have actual updates to offer and are indeed just doing it for the money). If you're this allergic to coming up with new ideas, why can't you at least do, say, a unique interpretation of the Beauty and the Beast fairy tale? Why not do a Jungle Book adaptation that retains the darkness of the Kipling novels? Why not rip off Kimba the White Lion and Hamlet in a different sort of way this time?This, naturally, brings us to The Lion King, which raises a question of how much of your film can consist of CGI before you lose the permit to even call it a ""live-action"" remake - or how much of a copy it can be of a more expressive and colorful animation before failing to qualify as its own movie at all. Maybe I'm just not smart enough to get it. Maybe this is the best thing to happen to cinema since Michael Haneke made a shot-for-shot remake of his own film Funny Games in 2007.James Earle Jones (sounding just as tired of all this as I am) still voices Mufasa, the first king of Pride Rock, and his child Simba is played by JD McCary as a cub and Donald Glover when he's an adult, hiding from the treacherous Uncle Scar (Chiwetel Ejiofor). Need I tell you what Scar does and then pins on Simba, to chase the latter away from Pride Rock and claim the throne? Probably not, but I can tell you that this supposedly bigger film does not remotely do justice the ""stampede"" sequence of the original. Again: why do you think more grounded-looking visuals and fewer colors make something more spectacular? Even the maddening Simba the King Lion is more fun to look at than this.Nala, love interest of Simba, is voiced by Beyoncé because who needs voice actors? John Oliver is decently funny as Zazu, the sycophantic hornbill. Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen provide comic-relief annoyance as Timon and Pumbaa. John Kani is Rafiki, the wise but eccentric mandrill who observes everything. Alfre Woodard gives motherly warmth as Queen Sarabi. Lastly, Keegan-Michael Key, Florence Kasumba and (most welcome of all) Eric André play the bumbling hyenas who answer to Scar. So there you have it. It's celebrities you recognize and characters you recognize, which is apparently all it takes. Tag a friend you HAVE to see this with!Jon Favreau has now answered the question that, judging by fan comments on Facebook, has been on everyone's mind since seeing the original Lion King: what if I could see this exact movie again only this time I'm just looking at regular lions, Rafiki stares at me blankly, and the lovable Pumbaa is just kind of a pig? The Lion King is too real-looking to be as fantastical as the 1994 film, but too obviously artificial to be as awe-inspiring as the beasts of the real world (Favreau ain't no Jacques Perrin). Even what Disney did with Dinosaur made more sense than this, as there is a shortage of real-life dinosaurs that we can photograph.I can hear your arguments already. ""If you don't like it, don't watch it!"" ""Let people like what they like."" ""I think it's fun to see my favorite movies with updated (sic) visuals and more hip-sounding music."" I get all of this, and I wish it were that simple.On some level, you have to know what you're voting for when you elect to pay for a film like this. You're telling Disney that you're satisfied seeing the same thing over and over again, hence their creative bankruptcy is not an issue, and even worse: you're apparently okay with the fact that those who made the original storyboards, wrote the original dialogue, invented the characters, and actually MADE THIS MOVIE in any meaningful sense reportedly don't get much of the cash.In case you didn't catch it: this remake is not only a ""f-ck you"" to 2D animation as an art form (with its implication that a graphics update is at all necessary to ""introduce the film to a new generation"") but a bigger one to the artists who created it, doing the heavy lifting for those who are now making the money. That, in a nutshell, is the 2019 Lion King.When a film is this repulsive, not because of content but because of what it essentially stands for, I usually give it 0. Don't be too shocked about my 1 rating. I'm being generous (mainly to the tormented VFX crew).","

"felipepm17","25 July 2019","I'll start with the best part: Timon and Pumba are fantastic. Now I want a whole movie just of them.
The cast was well selected and I feel that Beyoncé and Child Gambino don't bring anything special to the characters, any voice actor that can sing would do the same job. Beyoncé's original song didn't amaze me too, the song is beautiful but doesn't blend well with the rest of the movie.","

"fewtexan","29 July 2019","Total waste of time and money. Kept asking myself 'why' like: 'why am I still at this disaster?'.It was visually interesting (at least initially) but that wore away quickly. It just wasn't enough in the acting, dialogue, etc to keep you engaged. I guess if it was your first experience with the plot, then it would be okay. I would just buy the original.They missed the opportunity to have the animal be more natural and redo the story in way that educated about wildlife instead of misinforming.I realize this is fantasy, but I think they could have enhanced this cash cow instead of milking it dry. Definitely will not go to anymore Disney remakes.","

"conradstephanie","21 December 2020","I thought the effects were good, but Beyonce was awful. Her voice was way too mature for Nala. She should have been casted as the mother's voice. She also delivered her lines with no emotion as if she was just reading lines. After watching this remake, I appreciate the original so much more. I would have rated this higher, but Beyonce ruined it for me. They really should have used a much younger girl's voice for Nala. Very disappointing.","

"Rainbowbeany","18 July 2019","Wayyy back in the day I remember seeing this as a child. I remember the feelings it gave me. Seeing this 25 years later, it reminds of how good this story actually is. It is really neat to see how this remake has used photo realistic animals. I must admit that at first it is a bit odd to see them speaking but I got over it pretty fast. The parts with young Simba , Timone and Pemba were my favorite. They even throw a bit of meta humor in there for those of us that know Hakuna Matata by heart. Once he grew older was a delight as well with Donald Glover and Beyoncé. Beyoncé is and will always be a highlight in anything she is a part of. Some of the other parts suffered like Scar. I remember him being more theatrical. They didn't give him his campy sneer that I enjoyed from Jeremy Irons in the original. Having James Earl Jones back is pure magic. His voice is so iconic to Mufasa. The setting is beautiful. With everything looking so real it's surprisingly not as exciting at the same time. Sadly I was more taken in by the story when I was a child. Which I am sure your kids will take to this one as I did the original. Families will love it as well as animal lovers. This is a pretty straight forward remake. If you loved the original you will enjoy this. If you didn't then you should probably see something else because it isn't any different. Definitely worth the watch!","

The thing is that they are some shot that has been remade just to fit in good in this live action movie, like for example the one where the animals is like standing above eachother and so.
Also they putted out some new scenes that made some more charisma to some character, like Timon and Pumpa.In the cinema Everyone was laughing laud and was quite in exictment scenes or more seriouse and of course the one scene we all knew was coming... yep get my tissues already.But i recomend it for nostalgia and to see a more light up and is a change for a whole new genaration to see this as they may have not seen the original.

From the animals and the backgrounds and the settings everything looks beautiful. It looks realistic is what I'm saying. And all the vocal performances were really solid. James Earl Jones once again is a beacon of hope as Mufasa and I really loved him. And Seth Rogan and Billy Eichner as Pumba and Timon were really good as well. I even liked Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar even though he is no Jeremey Irons. Although this film feels like a repeat of the original with a few parts added in there. But is just feels the same. Overall this film has amazing visuals and a good voice cast but it feels like the original but in live actionFinal rating: 7.2/10","

"raretxpanda","21 July 2019","The CGI is great and the actors who portrayed Simba were great. Unfortunately they wanted the animals to be so realistic looking that they didn't show emotion in their face....and it took the love and magic in the film and left it pretty bland and boring. If the animals talk and sing (which isn't realistic)then they could have let them still make facial expressions. I was ready for it to end. I also expect more from Beyoncé....at the beginning of can you feel the love tonight it sounds odd like she's trying to add an accent to it...?! Also they had the song Can you Feel the Love TONIGHT performed in daylight!? Again losing some of the magic.... I didn't expect this film to be better than the original but I at least thought I'd like it more than I did... The Jungle Book was SO good and this film was lack luster. The cgi is truly amazing but aside from that it's not worth the remake...","

"cardsrock","26 July 2019","The Lion King (2019) is a stunning visual achievement, but unfortunately that's about the only achievement of this wholly unnecessary remake. It stays very close to the original, which is both good and bad. It feels at times like they're just waiting to hit all the notes audiences expect without supplying the raw emotion the original brought. Part of this is because hand drawn animation allows more emotional expressivity than CGI. Beyoncé can no doubt sing, however her casting here feels off. Rogen and Eichner are the only ones who seemed perfectly cast and expertly stay true to their characters while adding some new material. Ultimately, The Lion King remake is a sight to behold and nostalgia-inducing, but fails to justify its own existence.","

The CGI is amazing. If you like your wildlife programmes you will probably enjoy it.
The voice actors didn't bother me as much as others. I think Glover does a good job with adult simba and liked Rogen as Pumbaa.I think where the movie fails or rather struggles is to keep the audience emotionally attached like the original but when you're using real life looking animals it is going to be difficult.If you go to this movie forgetting about the original and not expecting that same magic then its pretty good. Its definitely watchable and does not deserve below 5 rating.","

It was really weird to see this realistic animals talk. They had a mouth that could form words, wich made the whole thing very awkward and not realistic again.

"olivewahh","14 November 2019","The Lion King is a story we all know and love, most of us grew up watching the classic animated version, but for the new generation being born it seems Disney want to retell these stories and reach a new audience.We know how the story goes, so there's no real spoilers going into this film. We go to relive a childhood film and see it's transformation into a computerised real life film.
Nothing in this film was real, even the trees, but it all looked so real and impressive.As the film starts and you hear the start of Circle of Life you should get that instant body chill, but this version just wasn't as powerful as the original. It left me unsatisfied, and to think this is only the beginning of the film where it needs to live up to expectation.This film publicity circled SO MUCH around Beyonce to hype fans up for the Beyhive fans. I like her as an artist, but personally I feel as though her voice for Nala was a terrible choice. There was just no emotion in her voice and seemed to always be one tone. I'm sure there would've been a better choice than Beyonce but I understand they locked in a huge pop artist to promote a film and bring in some coin.Overall I really enjoyed the film, the graphics were impressive and so real life looking, but it was the music and Beyonce that let it down for me.","

"Prismark10","31 March 2020","Disney has decided to have live action remake of its classic cartoons with mixed critical results so far. The box office though has been very good.The Lion King is not even live action though. It is a CGI version of the 1994 animated movie.The Lion King cartoon was a kid friendly version of Hamlet. Young cub Simba's father is killed by evil brother Scar but Simba blames himself as he does not know the truth of what actually happened.I would have thought director Jon Favreau would had shaken up the story but it is almost a straight remake of the 1994 cartoon.However this remake has a longer running time and it showed. I felt listless as the movie went on. I realised the film lacked energy because it knew it was a bland copy.","

"garabedbaghsarian","14 September 2019","When I saw the trailer of the remake for the first time, I had goosebumps all over and super excited to relive my childhood. But unfortunately, the only good part of the movie was the graphics, as at some point I thought I was watching a real-life film (but only the very first scene was shot in real life while the rest was CGI). But other than that, it lacked emotions. For example, the musical scenes were all over the place, and the fact that the songs were not sung by the original singers was already disappointing. Not to forget to mention about the most critical scene in the movie that was supposed to be the saddest moment (Simba crying at Mufasa's death) it didn't touch me at all, while if you watch the original, no matter what your age is, you would at least tear.
Furthermore, as much as Bomba was funny and perfectly played by Seth Rogan, the character was badly CGI-ed, looked like a cheap quality and ugly character.
All in all, I only recommend this movie for the sake of beautiful graphics and to remember the story, other than that you'll be disappointed for the lack of emotions (even though it's the exact storyline as the original movie)","

"FlashCallahan","20 August 2019","You can't blame Disney for recycling their classic movies in order to have them become more profitable by being 'live action'. But i really don't understand why the backlash is happening now. In 1996, they made a live action version of 101 Dalmatians.....Yes, their output has increased in the last couple of years, but as they are making so much money (Dumbo aside, but that was terrible), can you really blame them for reaping the benefits?Simba idolises his father Mufasa, and takes to heart his own royal destiny on the plains of Africa.But not everyone in the kingdom celebrates the new cub's arrival. Scar, Mufasa's brother -- and former heir to the throne -- has plans of his own. The battle for Pride Rock is soon ravaged with betrayal, tragedy and drama, ultimately resulting in Simba's exile.Now, with help from a curious pair of newfound friends, Simba must figure out how to grow up and take back what is rightfully his......The film isn't a patch on the original, that was an amazing exercise in genius, and probably one of Disney's finest hours. Even the 3D upgrade in 2011 didn't fade any of it's beauty.Now if you are of a certain age, like myself, you will see this as a pointless exercise, but imagine it in through the eyes of someone who has not seen the original? It must be as wonderful as when we first saw the animated original for them, and from that point of view, i have to respect the makers somewhat.Yes, it's amazing to look at, attention to detail is painstaking, and at times, the film is extremely sinister, not as much as the original, but sinister nevertheless.So all in all, it's a pretty pointless affair from my point of view, but there is going to be a new generation who are going to find a new love for this film, and kudos to them.","

Scenes with the animals are great, so was the voice acting, namely James Earl and Seth Rogen to name a few. And also very well directed by Jon Favreau, who also directed The Jungle Book. If you loved the original 1994 film, then give this film a look, you might like it.","

You can Dispute if it was necessairy or not, but I Judge it as a film itself and since it was basically shot-by-shot the same thing I of Course loved it for its Story, its tragedy and the fantastic Soundtrack. The visuals are among the best we have ever encountered on the big screen so that was another big plus. The only thing it lacked a Little bit was the emotionality that wasnt presented through the CGI characters as good as through the animated characters in the original. Sometimes the facial expressions (logically) were not as charismatic as they were and thus it was not posible to connect or engage to the characters as it was in the original. Also the Voice work was not as good, there are exceptions of Course James Earl Jones, Chiwetel Ejiofor were especially good and when Beyonce starts singing ""Can you feel the love"" I was won over.
Generally Nothing new at all (except for a few Scenes especially with Timon and Pumba) but still a great film for a whole new Generation.","

"jessfaith-45971","1 August 2019","The ""live-action"" lion king is one of the worst movies I've ever watched. The cgi was ugly, there was zero emotion and the voice acting at times felt forced. But, there are some pros:
-Timon and Pumbaa are hilarious
-Hyenas are awesome
-Soundtrack is amazing and intense and songs are sung wellAside from that, the film completely lacked emotion and was a shot-by-shot remake of the original. Many scenes felt like cheap copies and were shortened. I was angry at how emotionless some of the scenes were. Simba's reaction to Musfasa falling off the cliff was so ridiculous looking because of the horrible cgi. None of the characters looked that impressive. On top of that, there were some uncomfortable POV shots and it was kinda scary looking. The voice acting also sounded forced at times. During the movie, it felt like the voice actor was detached from the character; like it the character was just lip-syncing really badly.Scar was a big disappointment. Many of his lines sounded forced or didn't make him sound like a bad guy. One of the biggest let downs was ""long, live the king."" It was neither chilling or menacing sounding. And he talked his way through ""Be Prepared"" which was only the last verse from the original.
Another thing I didn't enjoy was how the characters started singing ""the Lion sleeps tonight"" because it felt forced and kinda out of nowhere. Oh and ""Can you feel the love tonight"" was ironically done in the middle of the day with sunlight.Overall, this movie is pretty bad. Unlike the live-actin Aladdin, which developed characters and added new ones, lion king brings nothing new. While not the worst movie I've ever seen, I do not recommend it or intend to see it again. The lack of emotion and the cgi effects will only make you wish that you were watching the original.","

However, this may be one of the more underwhelming films of recent times especially, if like me, you swear by the original. The dialogue is almost copy and pasted from the first film (James Earl Jones may as well not have bothered turning up) but if you grow up with the original than that's who that dialogue belongs to and anyone else does it a disservice. The music is also not as emotionally invoking and just feels like an extra thrown in to add more to the film. I feel it is unjust to rate this below a 6 due to the visuals being so amazing however if you have to pick then the original is the way to go.","

But it's so similar, that it can't be much worse.The animation is stunning. So no bad ratings to be given there.Emotionless characters because of the phororealistic CGI: That's really the only point where you CAN rate this movie very low, if you want. Because that's the only thing that's very different from the Original.So basically, if you liked the original or even thought it was a masterpiece, giving this one a bad rating is straight up illogical and idiotic. And most of you give it a 1 without seeing the movie!Gz, movie fandom has reached is absolute lowest point. Can only go up from here right?EDIT AFTER SEEING THE MOVIE:
All the above is absolutely correct.To me, this movie is great. There are a few dialogue problems against the end and there is a problem with emotions because of the CGI, but otherwise, it's fantastic.Get over it people, Disney wants money.

Which begs the question: when will Disney stop this train of remakes of classic Disney films and what is the point. Especially since Disney's main studio generally still puts up excellent original content, you can't help but wonder how far this is gonna go.

"marter2006","20 July 2019","The spoken words came across as flat, phony. The lines lacked energy, emotion, and heart. Most of the animation was amazingly accurate. The details of the hyenas and lionesses came across as too computerized for my taste. It wasn't very original, as you might expect.","

"GoUSN","19 July 2019","When the highpoint in a Disney film is a musical reference to another popular Disney film, we are in for an unoriginal evening.This remake excruciatingly follows the animated version, except for one thing: in the remake, Simba the cub looks like a plush toy.I don't have to comment on the plot and it would be impossible to write a spoiler because every detail of the original is repeated here.Every.Last.One.And the CGI. Sitting still, the animals were animals. Moving, though, was dangerous for the poor things. Sometimes jerky, sometimes not. Lion laying down? Either have the Lion hit the ground smoothly and naturally or keep the creature standing up. Chase scene needs multiple openings just small enough to slow down the predator, except for its big ugly face? (Maybe in 3D that becomes more exhilarating)I've also seen more than a few films where the actors look onscreen like they're waiting for stage direction and somehow the awkwardness makes its way into the final cut. But CGI animals? How could they possibly have been drawn that way?The kids in my life loved it, ages 4 to 15. So that's something.","

"carlos37andre","24 July 2019","One will argue what was the point of doing a remake that is almost bit for bit what the original movie was. And this is a fair point. But I'll talk about it later.
First I have to talk about the movies' positives. It's insane. The photo realistic animals are almost flawless, if they didn't talk, you could think you were watching an Animal Planet show or something. It's that level of perfection. And even the talking part, I think they handled pretty well, it doesn't feel strange. The voice acting is awesome too. Mainly Seth Rogen as Pumbaa steeled the movie for me.Well, and I think that's it as far as positives go. Of course, you will watch it, be amazed by the technology, and also entertained by the story, cause it's the original Lion King's story. But I understand the ones who asked for more in a remake as big as this one.The Lion King is a difficult property to reboot, knowing how well received the first movie was and still is, it's really difficult to think about a way to re-telling the story while still doing something new without pissing fans off. But when you have that much money and minds behind it, you have to do it. The technology is awesome, and this will certainly be remembered as a turning point in animation history decades from now. But still, I believe you needed more to justify rebooting such an important franchise.The story is almost bit for bit the same, there are 3 or 4 new scenes, that don't add nothing new to it, it's just to get to the 2 hours run time. The photo realism is amazing, but it can also be viewed as a problem, because of that realism the characters show very little emotion (I mean, it's hard to make a Lion show human-like emotions), I also found that because of realism as well, it was really hard to distinguish between some characters, namely the lionesses, when they weren't talking I had basically no idea if it was Nala or Simba's mother. Those are some of the two points I believe the original one beats this one quite easily.To sum up, the movie is entertaining, and it's for sure a turning point in movie technology, as Star Wars or Avatar were before it. It's historical. However, in the end, the question that remains is if we really needed this turning point to be in a Lion King re-imagination, that isn't really a re-imagination.","

"jre-5","26 August 2019","It's unbelievable how realistic the animals and scenery appear, it's hard to believe that it's animated and not filmed. I remember as a kid being astonished by the animation of the original film, but that was nothing compared to this. It's a shame that the realism made it so that the animals couldn't really show any emotion. I guess ""real"" looking animals and emotional stories just don't mix. The makers undoubtedly could've given the animals emotional expressions if they had chosen to. But when you stop and think about it, it is ""understandable"" why they didn't. I'm not necessarily saying that it was the right decision, but since the animals look real (as opposed to hand drawn artwork), it probably would've looked a little weird if they had showed emotions, since most real animals do not.The voice acting wasn't very good. I never thought there was anything special about the voices in the original film, but they were better than most of these. It also seemed a little weird that so many of the lines were pretty much identical to the original, this undoubtedly makes the new voices seem even worse for those of us who remember the way they sounded before. I really think they should've rewritten most of the lines and made more new events. The movie does have some new scenes, I liked the scene where Nala flees the land, this was a nice addition. But most of the scenes are pretty much the same as the original. It also became a bit boring at times. I think it would've been better if they had made more additions and changes, and perhaps some new songs.I think it's really neat when animated movies are remade in live action form (or seemingly live action form in this case). But what worked in one form doesn't always work in the other.","

"K-Noah","29 August 2019","The Lion King is directed by Jon Favreau, the director of The Jungle Book 2016, screenplay by Jeff Nathanson and starring Donald Glover, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Billy Eichner, Seth Rogen, Beyoncé Knowles and James Earl Jones once again as Mufasa.The Lion King is Disney's 3rd Live-Action remake this year. And in case you haven't watched the original, the plot is about Simba, a lion prince, after his father's death takes an adventure, and during this adventure he finds out that there's more in life than what he expected.The original Lion King movie is my favorite animated movie of all time, and it's in my top 3 movies of all time too, I think it's a masterpiece in every way possible, so I was super-excited to see how could they turn that masterpiece into a Live-Action remake, and I find it a little bit weird to call it ""Live-Action"", because technically, it's animated but in a very realistic way! We'll get to that point later.
I was also afraid, because The Lion King is so close to my heart, I grew up watching it, so I was afraid to see this movie fail or something, but fortunately it didn't!The Lion King has an impressive visual effects, it never felt CGI-ed or anything, it was so real, the details were very impressive, I like that very much, because the original was richly drawn with amazing colors, it's the best 2D animated movie ever made, and it was revolutionary, so it's good to see the Live-Action remake revolutionary too! But as it was impressive and pleasant to the eyes, it was also emotionless! That's my biggese with this movie, that there's no emotion is this movie, every scene it's just lions moving their mouths and words coming out, or just animals doing stuff, you never get attached to them the same way you did in the original, because in the original you saw them smile, cry, laugh.. you saw their emotions, and that touched us so deep sometimes, but in this movie, it wasn't even near to the original.The movie was also shot-by-shot a remake, for some that could be a huge problem, for me that all I wanted to see from this movie, I didn't expect anything more, though the movie adds 30 minutes, it didn't add enough to the story, it's just the plot of the original, and I'm okay with that, even the soundtrack was almost the same, same songs -only one new-, same OST by the same composer, so technically, they didn't do anything creative, or more than what they did back in 1994. It was all about nostalgia, to feel nostalgic to your childhood, and it did that perfectly, but there's no point to make this move, except for making somethings more clearer than the original, more animals talking, because that was weird to see only the main characters talking in the original, things that can make more sense than the original.. and money!The casting choices are amazing, everyone made a great job, to see James Earl Jones back as Mufasa, it added something more to the movie, Donald Glover was amazing as Simba, JD McCrary as young Simba too.. Seth Rogen as Pumba was magnificent, unfortunately, there's a so little of him in that movie, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar was the MVP of this movie, though he wasn't that great as Jeremy Irons, but he was so good as a villain! Billy Eichner as Timon is the worst, he didn't add anything to his character, and he was so emotionless, he wasn't that funny, even though, Timon was the hilarious part of the original, but Billy Eichner didn't do it right!The movie has 30 min more, and -as I said- they made added more sense sometimes, but sometimes they added scenes just to make it to almost 2 hours, and they even deleted some scenes of Rafiki, there were so little of him in this movie! The original has a great scene between Simba and Rafiki, and it's not in this one anymore.The Lion King gave justice to the original, though it did lack of emotions, and added some unnecessary scenes, and deleted an important scene, some of the changes were welcome, some not very, but still it was very good to see a great Live-Action remake from Disney again!I'm gonna give The Lion King an A-!Thank you guys, for reading another review of mine, if you liked this, click on my name up above and see all my reviews, look forward to my review of the original Lion King. Thanks again!","

"MrLucasWarHero","8 August 2019","I have always believed that the purpose of a remake was to produce a creative and new way of looking at an original story.When I went to see the remake of The Lion King, what I did not expect was a shot for shot remake that simply had better special effects. Honestly, I don't see why they even bothered hiring new actors to do the voices when Disney could have used exactly the same audio and simply reanimated it.The only new approach that this version brings to the table is more realistic special effects. I worry that a future generation of children will not ever bother watching the original Lion King because they'll say things like ""Why bother? The 2019 one is the same, but it looks better."" Next up we might as well do 3-D digital reproductions of Picasso that look sleeker than his old oil painted originals.Also when you create animation of animals that looks that real and yet they're talking and singing and dancing it produced an effect that I found a bit unsettling. What's next, anthropomorphic cats in harmony?","

"pokhrelnarhari","22 July 2019","This is a ""live action"" version of the original, which by itself was made entirely using computers. This ""live action,"" however, is also made entirely using computers, but the only difference is that this one has less emotions (sometimes there is no sense of emotions at all), the scene where Mufasa speaks with Simba does not live up to the old one neither goes along with the technology being used these days.
Long story short, the only good thing about this movie is that many people found a job while the filming lasted. Nevertheless, they would have been better off playing the same movie once again.","

"rockman182","20 July 2019","I think we all have seen The Lion King as a child. Whether you want to admit it or not, its a Disney classic. The songs and lines from the film are memorable and its up there with Disney animated ventures from their best decade. I question the need for every Disney live action film coming out but I've been surprised. Lion King was a strange case. Its got a great voice cast for sure but it looks like a feature length National Geographic documentary. I heard bad things about this going in. I'd say its decent. It follows the original work very, very, closely and I think it takes a lot of the if it ain't broke don't fix it philosophy.The film takes place in the animal kingdom, where the king lion Mufasa has recently had a son named Simba. This young cub is destined to be the new leader at the behest of his scheming and jealous uncle Scar. Simba quickly learns the dangers of being next in line for the throne and then has to learn how to grow up and be a leader to his kingdom. The film interestingly brought back James Earl Jones as the voice of Mufasa. The film has a lot of voice talent like Donald Glover, Beyonce, and Seth Rogen.The visual and realistic nature of the animals is fairly amazing. The animals look so real and the recreation of the original animated features scenes is pretty remarkable. I thought visually its as good as can be. The film could have used some originality for sure but I wasn't so bothered with a remake that closely follows the source material. I haven't seen the animated version in a long time so recalling moments through a new film wasn't so bad. I felt some parts were very rushed though and not done as well as the original.The score and recreation of the classic songs was nice regardless. I know there will be a lot of complaining and it won't please everyone but I felt like it was a solid film and a good enough watch. Not very many complaints. I don't think it possesses all of the magic of the original but its still a faithful effort and I really mean you can see the effort there visually but maybe not so much so creatively. Pretty sure this will be a cash cow regardless for Disney as it was pretty hyped.7/10","

Sadly in this remake some moments were modified for worse and the film's script felt choppy.Interactions between the characters feel slightly robotic at times, the voice actors could have been better. Seth Rogan was the best part.The script is simplified at times and parts of the original movie are watered down.The father clouds scene was a major let down. Nala's introduction to Simba as an adult is ridiculous.Overall the CGI is great, but the execution of key moments fail multiple times.","

I didn't even mind Beyonce voicing Nala, as her voice is so distinctive. The only song that I wasn't impressed by was Can You Feel The Love Tonight?

Half the time the principle actors seemed like they were just reading their lines and not really trying. James Earl Jones wasn't putting any emotion into it and seemed like he really didn't care as much this time around. Adult Simba and Scar were completely miscast, especially Scar. Someone with a deeper voice like Jeffrey Dean Morgan would've been a much better choice. Timone and Pumba on the other hand were great. All in all it was enjoyable but nowhere near the level of the original.","

First of all, this movie has been referred to as a live action remake. That is not true. It is CGI. But, it is very good CGI. It looks great. It's directed by Jon Favreau, who recently directed the live action remake of the Jungle Book. The original Lion King was made in 1994-with a couple of sequels-and only one of the original actors from those movies shows up here. James Earl Jones. They do use the original songs, plus some new ones, too. As far as the story goes, it's basically the same. James/Mufasa is the king of the jungle and when he has Donald/Simba, he wants to train him as the future king. Chiwetel/Scar is James' brother, who has dreams of being king, but is frustrated with the birth of Donald, the new heir to the throne. Beyonce/Nala is the girlfriend and future queen of Donald. Chiwetel in his bid for the throne, plans bad things for his brother-James-and his nephew Donald. Like I said earlier, the CGI looks incredibly life like. If you are a fan of the original, you should enjoy this one. I myself, am not a big Disney fan-they are ok but not my favorite-whereas my wife loves them so I'm sure she will really like this one more than I did. I will be taking her to see it at a later date.
It's rated ""PG"" for violence & peril and has a running time of 1 hour & 58 minutes.
It looked good and the story was good but it's not one that I would buy-except for the grandkids. It would be a good rental.","

The only new scenes are fillers to extend the run time from 90 minutes to 118 minutes, so the only 'good' things are the effects, but even that is questionable, because that removes the magic, that made the original so special.

"bankofmarquis","21 July 2019","I have to give the Walt Disney Company credit, with their Live Action remakes of their classic animated movies, they have developed a very lucrative profit stream with properties that they already own - and are well known to audiences. Some are successful (THE JUNGLE BOOK, ALADDIN), some are not quite so successful (DUMBO, ALICE IN WONDERLAND).And...somewhere in the middle...is the LION KING.Directed by Jon Favreau (THE JUNGLE BOOK, IRON MAN), this Lion King is a fairly faithful reproduction of the animated movie - and that is a blessing and a curse - and it, ultimately, keeps this remake squarely in the middle in terms of quality, interest and achievement.What works: the CGI animation of the animals and scenery. Favreau shot CGI-fest films like THE JUNGLE BOOK and IRON MAN, so he knows how to do these things and they work here in a very workmanlike way. The are all professionally done - there's not a bad shot in the film. But the ""wow"" moments are few and far between in this film as wellThe story is a timeless classic (kind of an ""animal adventure Hamlet"") and that works as do OME of the voice cast (more on that later)...and...of course...the songs - especially the faithful recreation of the CIRCLE OF LIFE opening - one of the best opening musical numbers in movie history.What doesn't work: The first 1/2 of the film's pacing. It drags pretty badly early on and the songs in that part of the film (like I CAN'T WAIT TO BE KING) just don't have the energy and pizzazz that is needed. And SOME of the voice work is just plain bland and boring and (in one case) I found irritating.So...let's talk about the voice cast. James Earl Jones (reprising Mufasa) is terrific (of course) as is John Oliver's Zazu (a much bigger presence in this film than the animated film), Chiwetel Ejiofor's Scar is appropriately menacing, if a bit bland, but ""good enough"" as is Beyonce's grown up Nala. I would have liked to see/feel a bit more of her ""presence"" in this character's voice, but that might be a Director choice and not an actress choice. John Kani's Rafiki is quite good as is the always steady/credible Alfre Woodward as Sarabi.What doesn't work is the two voice actors cast to play Simba. Donald Glover (TV's ATLANTA) is just too bland and boring as the adult Simba. He doesn't really bring anything interesting to his voice work of this character (but does hold his own in the musical duet ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"" opposite the great Beyonce).I usually don't comment on child performances that I don't like (they are kids after all), so I won't really comment much on JD McCrary's voice performance as the young Simba except to say I didn't really how much MORE the young Simba is in this film as opposed to the older Simba - or at least it felt to me that the weakest voice performance in this film was on screen for far longer than I remembered from the animated film.As for the best voice performances in this film - that is easy - Billy Eichner and Seth Rogan's performance as Simba's pals Timon and Pumbaa. They had big shoes to fill in comparison to the voice work in the animated film from Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella, so they did the smart thing - they didn't even try. Much like Will Smith not trying to imitate Robin Williams in the live action ALADDIN earlier this year (another voice performance that worked well) Eichner and Rogan make these characters their own and succeeded well - these two characters/performances are the high point in the film and bring much needed life and energy to a movie that was sagging under it's own weight by the time they show up.This Lion King will be THE Lion King for this generation - and that is ""fine"" - if the youngsters in my life want to watch this, I won't complain. But... I will try to steer them towards the much better animated version of this film from the 1990's.Letter Grade: a solid B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)","

"krisboogie","7 August 2019","The movie definitely succeeded in bringing the feelings of nostalgia and the voice actors did well. However, the hyper-realistic cgi didn't allow for the full emotions to show through. We lost a lot of the feelings by not being able to see the more human-like expressions you could relate to in the cartoons like furrowed eyebrows or teary eyes or big smiles etc. Instead it was kind of like those instagram videos where people do voice overs for animals in funny situations except with super HD national geographic type visuals. I think they could've gone for realism but held back some in the faces of the animals to allow for some of that emotion to still show through.I wouldn't buy it or necessarily choose to see it again but I enjoyed it for what it was in the moment.","

Hats off to all the artists that worked on this.However, because they've made it so close to photo realistic, the talking and singing lions just felt wierd to me. I just couldn't suspend belief that much.So why did disney feel the need to remake one of the best animated movies of all time? They couldn't recreate the magic. They almost did it shot for shot too. But the appeal of the 2D version just didn't translate into this version. If they'd kept the character designs cartoony, maybe it would have.

That's about it. The rest of the cast were awful. The makers of the film didn't make the film their own. To be honest, I didn't feel much emotion towards Simba, he did come across pretty useless. Also the ending was rushed. Overall, Disney have ruined a brilliant classic.",NA

I love and respect the massive amount of work that they put on this film!Just by looking at the mountain textures... Oh, what to say... there were tears in my eyes. My eyes couldn't believe what I've had seen on this piece of work, so realistic.I'm a photographer and this blows my mind, depth of field consideration, the field of view, motions, textures, consideration of the light behaviour... Did I mentioned the magnificent power of the sound works!8/10",NA
"vandrist","19 July 2019","Visually this movie is phenomenal and realistic, it felt like you were watching and experiencing a true live action remake which felt like you were watching an episode of LIFE. Unfortunately what it made up for in visuals, lacked it almost every other way. There are key moments from the original that I felt spoke to me the most were omitted from this remake. It felt as though the actors were just saying their lines and didn't show the emotion or soul that viewers were owed. For the most part there weren't anyone that stuck out. James Earl Jones has always been the standout with his voice still being as powerful. I think casting was a bit of an issue. I think Donald Glover would have been more suited for young Simba and probably would have killed it. Timone ane Pumba started to grow on me the more the movie went on, but there's no replacing Nathan Lane. John Oliver came across as annoying sometimes as Zazu. I didn't feel the soul in Rafiki for most of his part. The beginning was a tad disappointing, I couldn't wait for young Simba to grow up, middle was very good and the ending was just okay. And the songs just didn't really do it for me. Spirit wasn't really put in the right part of the movie. The songs that weren't sung by the actors still held true to the original and Hans Zimmer did his thing.In my honest opinion if this was a shot for shot remake of the original it would have been a slam dunk but it get more like a cash grab. I think it was better than Aladdin, but maybe if they took Mulan's approach it could have been a different movie entirely.Visuals: 10/10

"SomeGuyStudios","20 July 2019","Really bad. All you have to see is the opening sunrise and you know this movie is trash. Nothing was good or even on par. Now I'm not going to mention the original because to rate this movie I pretended it never existed. if it didn't everyone would hate it the songs have rhythm problems and chord progression problems. No one can sing or act but that's because they aren't trying. They know people will like this movie even if it is garbage. I don't even know what happened with the editing it was like a 4th grader did it. Everyone Has No Character. Scar Is Just a Lion Now. They Didnt Try Writing Characters Because People Are Already Invested in The Story Before It Even Begins. Oh Look Mufasa Died I Take Every Thing Back Mufasa Was so Interesting This Movie Isnt Dependent on The Original at All. the Mulan Movie Looks Terrible but It Doesnt Matter Just Give Disney All of Your Money so They Can Keep Making These.",NA
"random-70778","18 October 2019","Wow. The original was a great musical version of Hamlet, or more accurately a fusion of several ancient Greek myths on disfranchised prince who finally avenges his father.This version is just an amazingly idiotic adaption of those archetypal themes.",NA
"schmidever","4 August 2019","This movie was neither great or bad. This was basically a book by book movie of the original. The animation was stunning and certainly the highlight of the movie. The cubs looked awesome, the animals great and the scenery was just breathtaking. However, I believe that is what greatly deterred this film as well. The photo realism sucks the life out of the film---the characters are lacking the facial expressions and the audience is not able to emotionally connect with them and the scenes which they are in. Compare the scene of the wildebeest and Mufasa's death---there is a glaring difference between the animated and 2019 film and that is just one of many. The voice acting, while not terrible, seems to take a noticeable drop from the original. I recognized many instances where the phrases were slightly altered or the voices did not say the the lines with as much feeling or enthusiasm. In fact, even the original voice actor who played Mufasa did not put as much feeling and emphasis like he originally did(my dad felt exactly the same way after watching it at drive-in theator). The song ""Be Prepared"" was also heavily butchered; so disappointing. In addition, they also butchered the character Rafieki a bit---taking out several of his memorable lines and hilarious charm. I also did not care for that song written by Beyonce towards the end. The original tune fit it much better. All that being said, this is still a solid movie on its own and the photo realism makes it at least worth a watch, especially for animation aficianodos. Besides that, this film is a clear drop-off in almost every single way from the original---voice acting, pacing, character expression, music, etc. A solid movie on its own, but very lackluster if compared to the original.",NA
"hannah-barry-824-673630","28 July 2019","Cute movie but lacking somehow.
The visuals were great but the Actress/Actor choices didn't match the characters.
Seriously, why did you choose Beyoncé! Such a letdown and so many other options of actresses who actually deserved the role and would have helped make his film.
Jennifer Hudson would have been a stunning choice with her voice!That said the other actors/actresses did quite well..The original animated film is still legendary. This one is good for the realistic visuals but just seems part of the hype with all the new Disney films.",NA
"hiphopphotos","21 July 2019","On a scale of 1-10, I give this animated film a 10. The film captures not only the emotions as it did 25 years ago, but the animated technology is phenomenal. Watching this film with my mom and my daughter, took me back to when we all climbed in one bed and watched with our popcorn and soda ""EVERY SINGLE SATURDAY"". When ever we visited my mom, my daughter ran straight to this movie-simply to fall right asleep. While my daughter is now 25, watching this animated film, reminded me all the wonderful emotions as a new 1st. time Mom. Some one wrote, there wasn't enough emotions from the characters-too much emotions would've made this full of realism film, a bit corny and cartoonist.",NA
"nethy-nho","20 July 2019","Off course remade one of the best animations it's very risky but Disney is determined to do this., just for pure nostalgia, I decided to watch this, and I think that the real problem is because this new movie don't try change anything, so why do a remake if you just will be copy everything.. sure, had some tine differently things, but nothing that can change the story, said that, at least they did a amazing work wit the CGI, the photography's is wonderfull, and the new voices into the old musics are incredible sometimes better, and like always, Timon and Pumbaa are the funniest characters on the movie.",NA
"educallejero","24 July 2019","OH MY GOD! With everyone complaining about the ""expressionless animals"" I wasn't expecting sooooooo much expression. They do smile (a bit), and express compassion, love and fear (but of course, not like the 94' cartoons, that would be unrealistic and dumb).Did someone notice these guys made animals talk? I repeat. Animals talking! Real animals talking. It's incredible!So:
Visually: Best animation ever
Story: Really good, but it feels a bit for kids, a bit simplistic.And then the problems:
Acting: Some great (Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar and the comedic trio of Rogen as Pumba, Oliver's Zazu and Billy Eichner's amazing Timon), some lackluster (Glover's Simba) and some lame (Beyoncé as Nala)Music: Really bad. I didn't remember the original songs, and now in home I'm listening and they improved ""Be Prepared"" (Scar song); and maintained the good Hakuna and Circle of Life.
Other than that, the music is the same with some new ones added. And all of them were AWFUL. Disgusting music. So freaking BORING! I HATED IT. The ""Coco"" soundtrack may as well be the entire Johann Sebastian Bach life work compared to this.
And that's why it wasn't perfect.",NA
"trevorwomble","21 July 2019","I can see a LOT of effort went into this remake. Cutting edge technology and a talented voice cast, nice direction and a great sountrack. But unfortunately despite all this, I felt it didn't hold a candle to the 25 year old original.Part of the problem is that I felt it stuck too closely to the original rather than expand upon it. At times it was almost a scene for scene remake and that was a major issue as they were too similar. Sure, stick to the story of the original but at times this was incredibly predictable because it was so close. Even many of the gags and a lot of the dialogue was lifted ad verbatim from the original and I felt it took away from an otherwise impressive effort.The screenwriters should have added their own flourishes whilst keeping in some of the crowdpleasing moments from the 1994 version. Granted the film contains the great songs from the original, albeit it done in different styles, but i'm afraid I felt a little underwhelmed at times. As wonderful actor as Chiwetel Ejiofor is, I badly missed Jeremy Irons memorable turn as the voice of Scar complete with that menacing delivery, although at least Jon Favreau had the common sense to keep the wonderful James Earl Jones (now 88 years old!) as Mufasa to give it some of the class of the original. Some of the other recasting has been well done (John Oliver as Zazu for one captures the essence of the Rowan Atkinson turn on the original).I really wish I could have rated this higher but I can't but help compare it to the fabulous original and think this is a pale imitation that should have been allowed to take it's own path to bring something different t the table.",NA
"catsy29","5 August 2019","The visual effects are stunning. Probably the best CGI I have ever seen.But the story, zzzzzz. I was so bored. Such a lack of passion, there is no essence in this movie.I am sad for the generation that will grow up with this version. I didn't even see a kid crying. Is The Lion King! I still cry!I am a 90s kid. I grew up with The Lion King. Still, I only saw the whole movie twice because I couldn't take ""that scene"". It was so devastating to me that I still feel it. I had to skip it everytime.It was such an emotional event for me. I am now 28 and, I am trying to watch it again but I get cold feet because I know it will be very painful.The Lion King is not just one of the best animated movies of the whole time. It's also one of the best movies ever made.I didn't want to watch this version. But I was with my little cousins and I said, why not?.What a huge mistake. This movie didn't make me feel a thing.The CGI is amazing but the emotions are just not there. You can't put human emotions on the face of a real lion. It looks creepy and just doesn't work. It doesn't translate well.And the changes of the original story were not too many. But still it felt very short and hollow.I was just waiting for the movie to be over.Also, if Disney was going to make a reboot. Why not update the story? Why not talk about climate change?That is something that the Ice Age has done so well.It was a missed opportunity to deliver such an important message right now. I think there is not one healthy ecosystem right now on Earth.I wish this movie were not a reboot but a ""based on"". So, they could give us something fresh.I didn't understand the whole concept of the controlled hunts. I know in the animated version made sense. But if you are going to go realistic, follow the rules of the reality you have created.At the ceremony of the introduction of the new king, why the hell the herbivores were celebrating?I was such a bizarre and unintentional funny moment.This was a very bad experience. I don't recommend this movie to anyone. Not even children.Children should stick to the original. And Diseny too.We want original content. Not half-assed ""reboots"".Please. Stop.",NA

"cortex-18937","2 August 2019","Watching a remake of a classic like The Lion King you obviously watch with high expectations. I believe if you remake something you either keep the original script or change it entirely. But with this 2019 version they ended up in an awkward in between. Apart from James Earl Jones and Seth Rogan, I think the recast choices were poor. Though Beyonce may have been successful with covering the songs I did not find her the best fit for the voiceover enacting which to be fair is a difficult task and not for any actor. The transformation of Timon into a feminine gay male character did not fit in the original scenes and script. Young Simba's character is more arrogant and cowardly than the original which again didn't fit well. Rafiki lost some of his good scenes and is silenced most of the time. Over all the characters are with less emotion. And unfortunately although it is still a movie to enjoy (credit given to the original classic story and the spectacular visuals), you may leave disappointed a bit missing the original. Spectacular Visuals spoiled with Poor casting/ Directing",NA

"joannae-32397","31 July 2019","The animation is gorgeous and yes some of the voices seem a little odd over live animation but it was worth watching. I felt like some of the songs were better than the original and then some weren't. You will never top Elton John. Worth the watch!",NA
"subxerogravity","19 July 2019","I remember watching the live action adaption of Aladdin. I thought to myself if you like the animated film, you'll like the live action one. No one can replace the great Robin Williams, but Will Smith's take on the genie was well worth seeing, as well as the political updates they made to certain characters for 2019.
Now A lot of people loved the original Lion King, but I don't feel that if you love the original you'll love this one.
It's funny, I'll give it that. Seth Rogen and Billy Eincher as Tamon and Pumba are great. Keegan Micheal key and Eric Andre as the hyenas are fantastic!
Everything else...is noticeably not better that the original.
What I really feel weaken it for this adaption was the music. Same songs from the first movie where not poppin at all. I just can't wait to be king did not have the same flavor. The song that Scar( who was horrible in this film)sings lost something in its attempts to be more menacing.
I'm not trashing the movie. It was good. Just letting you know what worked and what didn't (In order to brace a certain generation who is in love with the original, cause you won't love the remake, you may only like it)",NA
"The CyberHippie","1 November 2019","After reading some of the top listed reviews here I was almost reluctant to watch the movie. I don't understand the criticism. Of course you're not going to get the same expressiveness in a photo-realistic animal character that you would from a cartoon, nor should one expect that. But this movie has much of the charm of the original in the story telling combined with CG artistry that is absolutely stunning.
This movie should be accepted at face value and not compared to the cartoon from which it was based. It has it's own magic. The incredible effort put into the graphics was not lost on me, the animators didn't get a hair or blade of grass out of place. The music score was better in the original, but that was a high bar to clear, but overall this movie should not be missed.",NA
"chloeurc","21 July 2019","This film was awesome in my opinion, the effects are done with excellence and I believe it will go the Oscars regardless of what critics rated this film. Of course it's not as impactful as the original but pretty dang close.",NA
"Sam56800","16 August 2019","I normally don't write reviews but this movie was so bad I just had to write something. This is absolutely nothing like the original. Yes, the visuals are spectacular and photoreal. But the emotionality and excitement from the animated version are nowhere to be found. It was like watching a BBC documentary with voice actors dubbed over. And not even good ones! Scar felt like he was half-asleep, with no sinister tone at all. The songs, which were so brilliant and melodic in the original, are completely stripped, watered-down, and just... empty. When I heard the lead-up to ""I Just Can't Wait To Be King"", I was waiting eagerly for the BOOM moment when the song would start, the trees turn red, and all the animals work together to get rid of Zazu. Instead, what you get is Simba's mouth barely moving along, and just a casual romp through the swamp. There is a significant lack of emotion in the eyes, mouth, and overall depth of the characters. It felt like they had no personalities. I have to say, as much as I love the advancement in technology and visual effects, there is a lot left to be desired in this remake, and I still think classic animation, when done properly, portrays character, heart, soul, and emotion much better. I had no idea how good the original was until I saw how bad this one is.",NA
"MinistryofDoom","16 October 2019","Jon Favreau is back with another amazing film experience. After showing what he could do with the incredible live-action/cgi version of The Jungle Book, he's back with Lion King. I won't go into the story too much because unless you've been living under a rock, you already know the story of Simba the Lion Cub. Favreau's film truly shows us how far we have come in terms of technology and film-making. Lion King is a film that could have never been made 20 years ago. The photo-realistic CGI is absolutely incredible. The film truly captures and brings to life the magic and beauty of the Disney animated classic. It's so detailed, so beautiful, so realistic that you might actually think that you're watching a National Geographic documentary about the African Savanna.This is a fantastic film for kids (and adults) of all ages. Though some of the photo-realism lends itself to being a bit scary for younger viewers. Particularly when the Hyenas emerge from the darkness to attack young Simba.The voice-acting was top notch. Most of the main cast were African actors, which I'm very happy about. James Earl Jones reprises his role, from the 1994 classic, as Mufasa, while Chiwetel Ejiofor voices Scar, the evil Lion. Beyonce Knowles is adult Nala, while Jaydon McRary and Donald Glover play young and old Simba, respectively. Look out for John Oliver as Zazu, the bird advisor of Mufasa and Simba, and the hilarious Seth Rogan as Pumbaa the warthog, bringing to his portrayal the same infectious laugh and witty banter that hes' known for.",NA
"Avatar_of_Khonshu","19 July 2019","So visually this is beautiful and goes to show the impressive strides in CGI.Now the but, This will be compared to its source material, in this case the impressive animation. Where has the live action faltered ? for me clearest example is Scar, the animation is voice by Jeremy Irons, and pretty much every line utters you can sense the malevolence under pinning the voice, this version voiced by Chiwetel Ejiofor simply does not portray that.The songs throughout the film are subtly different to the, with only Circle of Life really pulling the same gravitas as it's counterpart, the much toned down 'Be Prepared' fell so flat, mainly I suspect as Disney have been unconformable with previous references from the animated,Is it worth watching at the cinema, yes
Is it going to hold the same reverence as the original, only time will tell",NA
"EinatB","19 July 2019","Dialogues were changed to become more shallow & simple (for example word plays were taken out). The live action animation is too lack of expression - that it simply can't do well with the voice acting (& I'm speaking even without comparing it to the 94 version).
The hardest thing for me was the music downgrade:
Yes, they went with more heavy, accented vocals than music (a positive thing), but they used it all wrong (for example using an iconic theme in a different scene or out of sync with whats goes onscreen).
There were other changes I was onboard with, and though they were a refreshing take- but it doesn't saves this movie from being a complete grey yawn.",NA
