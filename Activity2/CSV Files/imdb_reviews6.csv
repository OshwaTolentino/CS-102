"Ratatouille","cinephile-27690","9 November 2018","That's what the food critic, Anton Ego, says in his review of the movie's restaurant at the end of the movie. That is a good way to sum up Ratatouille.This movie released a few days after my 9th birthday. My Grandma got the DVD and I loved it. I was a kid and animated movies were my jam! I even taped a Disney Channel showing on a record-able VHS. I have seen this numerous times, and I still love it. I just saw it again as a 20 year old and it still puts me in awe.The movie is about Remy, a rat who has an obsession with food, cooking, and the humans who cook food. He meets a chef who can't cook very well, and he uses his talent to secretly help him. But that causes issues with a secret rat in a failing restaurant.I can't think of a single flaw with this movie.The animation is beautiful(I noticed one car that almost looked real at one point)and the story is well told.I know when I love a movie when I feel this thrill in my heart and an excitement along with it.(See my review of Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King) I felt that all throughout this movie, even though I have seen this movie numerous times.This is an animated movie where you don't need to be a kid to enjoy it. (Roger Ebert said this as well.) Anton Ego also says that he will return to the restaurant ""hungry for more."" Revisiting this as an adult makes me say the same thing about the movie he is in.Edit: Nearly 11 months later, 7/7 people found the review helpful. I appreciate the positive feedback from everyone!

"Ratatouille","planktonrules","9 July 2007","This film is exactly what Pixar needed to steal the thunder from Dreamworks' latest release, SHREK III. In many ways, this is very ironic, as one of Pixar's best films, MONSTERS INC., was overwhelmed when it was released due to the first SHREK's success. I honestly think if SHREK hadn't been such a wonderful movie, people would have noticed that MONSTERS INC. was an exceptional film. Now, Pixar gets some payback with one of their best, RATATOUILLE.Actually, RATATOUILLE is probably Pixar's best film, though I did enjoy TOY STORY II and THE INCREDIBLES. The reason I was so overwhelmed by this story was that it was so highly original and creative--I simply cannot compare the plot to any other film (something you can do with THE INCREDIBLES and TOY STORY II). Plus, after years of making CG movies, the look is taken to a whole new level in this film--it just looks breathtaking.Now I need to point out that RATATOUILLE is not as much a kid's movie as its predecessors. Sure, it can be enjoyed by the kids, but the story line is a tad darker and covers an adult concept (illegitimate birth) and includes a swear word (though not one the really ""bad"" ones, you can be sure). Also, while the rats are kind of cute (and a marketer's dream), most of the rest of the story isn't and there are no catchy kid's tunes. No, instead this film is aimed more at teens and adults in its sensibilities--something that really helped make SHREK a financial gold mine and cursed MONSTERS INC. to be seen (incorrectly) as ""just a kid's movie"".Amazing animation, excellent writing and, the rarest of rare, a completely original and captivating plot make this a winner and film that will be long remembered. I can't wait to see it again.","

"Ratatouille","Hitchcoc","4 May 2019","The absolutely absurd premise of a rat becoming a great French chef is brought to fruition by Pixar. It starts by being amazingly colorful and capturing the world of food. Secondly, it is downright funny but does not insult the intelligence of the viewers. Food becomes the background for everything and as the tiny rodent gains popularity, we are pulling for him. This is such an intelligent film and it works at every level.","

"Ratatouille","PoisonKeyblade","17 June 2007","The combination of Disney and Pixar never ceases to amaze, but with Ratatouille, their newest effort, animated features are brought to new heights with the best one to date. Ratatouille is stunning, surreal while at the same time realistic, and a joy to watch. The writing is, in one word, just amazing, and the voice acting is sensational. The characters are poetic and real, and the rats are some of Disney/Pixar's cutest creations. Ratatouille is written and directed by Brad Bird (The Incredibles), and features stellar voice acting from Peter O'Toole, Patton Oswalt, Ian Holm, Brian Dennehy, Lou Romano, Brad Garrett, and Janeane Garofalo.Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt) is a little rat who dreams of becoming a chef just like his idol, the human Gusteau (voiced by Brad Garrett). After a mishap, Remy loses his family in the sewers and comes upon a fading restaurant that had previously been owned by Gusteau before his untimely death. He comes upon a lowly garbage boy, Linguini (voiced by Lou Romano), and together they set out to revive the once-legendary restaurant.Ratatouille is filled with loads of surprises and lots of twists and turns. The animation is even more stunning here than in some of the other Disney/Pixar productions, and the breathtaking landscape of Paris, France, really adds a layer of realism to the film. The food looks so real and delicious, and the humans and rats look incredibly realistic. Remy and Linguini are both lovable characters, and the audience is rooting for them the entire way. Surprisingly enough, this movie is the funniest of the Disney/Pixar films, with very subtle and unique humor.As previously stated, the voice acting really makes the film different, and each actor is perfectly suited to his or her role. The best among the bunch happens to be Lou Romano, as he deals with his character extremely well and is incredibly believable. There are times when the acting and animation is so excellent that you forget you are watching an animated film altogether. Brad Garrett is actually tolerable for once, and is excellent in his role as Gusteau, who acts as Remy's conscience for the majority of the film. Some of the funniest scenes in the movie are rooted from Gusteau's chats with Remy and many others come from the relationship between Linguini and Remy. On another note, Patton Oswalt does a magnificent job voicing Remy, and Peter O' Toole is very memorable as Anton Ego, the food critic for 'The Grim Eater'.Overall, you can't ask for a better film than Ratatouille, a new classic from Disney/Pixar that is filled with humor, amazing animation, and, most importantly, lots of heart. Some of the scenes are so poetic and perfect that they just bring tears to your eyes. It may be hard to believe, but Ratatouille is far better than any other animated films you will see this year, or perhaps that you will ever see. It manages to be better than Toy Story, better than Finding Nemo, even better than the fantastic Meet the Robinsons. I saw a pre-screening of the film on Saturday, June 16, but I cannot wait to see it again once it hits theaters everywhere on June 29. See Ratatouilleit is highly original, heartwarming, uplifting, and a very thrilling movie that has to be the best animated feature of the last few decades.","

"Ratatouille","willden21","17 June 2007","I caught a sneak peak yesterday, and must say, this film is a classic. It is not as flashy as cars, or as action packed as Incredibles, but it is a masterpiece of restraint and heart, that matches the classics from the golden age of the film industry. Pixar has always been groundbreaking for smart and fun animated features, but Ratatouille might just be what puts them over the top as one of the BEST all around film-making teams in history.Ratatouille is a treat for film lovers. It feels like a classic. The animationis absolutely beautiful, especially the scenery of Paris which evoked awes from the audience, as if we were seeing a grandiose fireworks show.The story is oh so classy and universal, especially when you look at it as a parable to yourself and society. Sometimes the story seems familiar, yet it is packed with so much genuine heart and individuality, that it might even be too ""indie"" for most audiences. But those who are patient and willing to open their minds and hearts, even when it may challenge the viewers to rethink their own personal biases, will find within this entertaining, sweet, simple film a remarkable message about challenging societal norms and not letting anything stand in your way of your dreams. When you follow your dreams, you never know what an impact it will have upon you, or those you might encounter on the journey. Just see the film, and be open to its message, and I am sure if you allow it too, it will touch you as well.P.S. : The short in front of the feature is the funniest animated short film pixar has ever done, so even if ratatouille might not be as flashy as many might want it to be, the short film will have everyone in stitches, as it did our entire theater. So just go and see it, and be prepared for a wonderful two hours.","

"Ratatouille","Quinoa1984","29 June 2007","It's pretty easy to make little rodents charming and fun characters (just ask Disney himself, to a clichéd extent), but it's even harder to make them work in such a way that's original and exciting as comedy in conventional ways for today's audiences. But Brad Bird shouldn't be lumped into the group of today's CGI animators. He doesn't really think in those terms, but rather in how to make things look real, and yet at the same time keeping in full mind that it's a cartoon, not reality. This goes not simply for the rats themselves- the funniest, probably even funnier, that Disney's remotely had to market since the Great Mouse Detective- but the human characters too, who have their own distinct shapes and qualities based on personality and relevance to the story (whether they're good or bad, or maybe even more complex too). He places the designs for the characters right up there with the rest of the atmosphere, and then also adds in just the right way to make that wonderfully formulaic Pixar storyline- you know a lot of what may unfold, though not everything, and you know that you're in excellent hands because of the levels of detail and nuance in the comedy chaos at times. It'll be hard to beat this (to put it in a corny phrase) 'gourmet selection' as the best animated film of the year, and certainly the best that Pixar's done since, um, the last Brad Bird movie! The story is the fish out of water, or in this case rat, where a little rodent named Remy, who is totally immersed in the style of Augustus Gusteau, a famous French chef who dies, and who's position is filled by a lowly garbageman named Linguini. He can't cook, of course, but somehow Remy, separated from his rat family, cooks something up on the spot as a not-quite accident, sending Linguini as the one who supposedly made it. On the fluke, he becomes the new chef at Gusteau's...only, the chef's a rat, literally, hilariously pulling Linguini's hair to make him a cooking puppet (early on this makes for some of the best physical comedy of any Pixar movie). This fluke becomes the start of the usual ball of string unraveled bit by bit, involving an heir to Gusteau's fortune, a love interest in aggressive chef Colette, and Remy's reconnection and estrangement from his huge rat clan and his father. All the while Bird throws in such dangerous and downright devilish comedy for a *G* rated animated movie. And there's morales to be learned too, or sort of taken away, I guess, only this time in the true Disney form instead of Pinocchio and Jiminy Cricket, it's Remy and the, well, illusion of Gusteau's ghost appearing to him as a quasi-conscious.What makes Ratatouille stand out of the pack from the fellow summer far of the moment, particularly 4th of July fare, is how there's such deft to Bird and his team navigating along the lines of making the comedy work to its excessive lengths while always keeping a firm grip on which turn the story will take next (the moments I didn't quite expect- the whole heir angle involving Linguini, and the climactic scenes with the rats preparing the restaurant's dinners, all washed before going to work, and keeping 'under wraps' the health inspector at the same time!). I probably laughed just as much during this film as I would at something much raunchier like Knocked Up or Grindhouse, to give recent examples, but as mentioned there's a riskiness to Bird's style here.One scene I particularly loved is when Remy is training linguini to command the muscle-controlled hair pulling scheme at his home, and there's a build-up to what seems like a knife going to cut into his fingers while he's chopping vegetables (up to this point he's been hopeless in his training), but at this very point where we should expect the worst, which is funny unto itself, it starts to level out and he's sort of under control. Sort of in that he'll still be naturally clumsy enough to spill the wine on his own head. Same goes for little things like the quite silhouetted bit Remy passes by with the lover about to shoot the other and then falling into full embrace, or the actual fellow employees at Gusteau's, one of who has the wildest thumb ever shown in a movie, least of all a 'family' movie, that I can remember (albeit Bird does come out of working on the Simpsons).So many masterstrokes of comedy go on that it's almost neglected to note how exciting a lot of the film is too, the run-around Remy has in the kitchen first time he comes in or the chase through Paris between the crooked head cook Skinner and Remy, and how seamless voice-work and the (now highly expected) advances in Pixar's technical innovations go together. It was a good guessing game who was the voice of Ego (it's O'Toole, but then it could be any given old regal British person), and to pick out that it's Ian Holm or Garofolo voicing some of the other parts, but it's not something that is immediately meant to be stand-out like in other CGI movies where it's being sold mostly on celebrity voice talent. It's almost like a lot of this comes quite naturally to Bird and his team, and yet because it isn't it reverts to becoming all the more remarkable. Ratatouille is simply an exceptionally fun picture, loaded with sight gags and puns and slips of behavior, and never overbearing with any of the usual messages that come pre-packaged for kids in these movies, all the more remarkable as it comes nearer to Pixar reusing previous ones.","

"Ratatouille","stalcup","17 June 2007","Remember how everyone was talking about Toy Story when it first came out? The incredible visuals, unique style, vividly imagined world? The next time people were talking that way with such enthusiasm about a computer animated movie was Finding Nemo. I'm excited to say that Ratatouille will be the next one to redefine the visual creativity and technical detail of computer animated movies. Honest to goodness, I was awestruck by the animation, and that never happens to me. It is a visual masterpiece of a movie if ever the term applies.The next thing to talk about is the ""genre"" of the movie. As Pixar enthusiasts will tell you, Brad Bird, the director of Ratatouille, also directed The Incredibles, which has the most inspired and creative action sequences from any of the Pixar movies. Ratatouille, while not so straightforward with its action, has almost as much as The Incredibles did, in unique ways. Most memorable is the shotgun scene near the beginning. (You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it). Other than that, this is the expected comedy-with-heart movie from Pixar that so many have grown to love.The voice acting? Spot on. Every voice is distinctive, and it never feels like a celebrity's voice tacked on to a character (Shrek, I'm looking at you), it feels like the characters themselves speaking. You can't ask for more from voice acting.And finally, the script and the story. The entire irony of the story -- a street rat with a passion for fine food -- is beautiful, and a tight, smart, wonderful script flows from this. The pacing of the story is odd and choppy at places, but this is a very forgivable grievance. The only other minor fault is that a few of the dramatic one-liners feel a bit forced. Other than that, this is the most layered, complex, and satisfying script from Pixar since The Incredibles.Overall, I recommend that everyone see this movie when it hits theaters (I was lucky enough to see a pre-release screening). Though not perfect, it is an animated masterpiece in true Pixar form with breathtaking animation and visual design.10/10","

"Ratatouille","ashowen","16 June 2007","This film is fantastic! Pixar has yet another great film to add to their impressive repertoire. Oscar-winning director and screenwriter Brad Bird, who wrote and directed ""The Incredibles"", has produced a film with subtle humor, heart, and very profound truth. The voice actors are so great, and it is especially great to hear Peter O'Toole on the screen. The animation is beautiful and it is all around an excellently made film. Its message is one that holds so much truth for everyone, especially today's youth: it tells people that no, not anyone can do anything, but if you have the talent you don't have to be limited by your surroundings or your upbringing. I think this is refreshing to hear because often, children are lied to when they are told they can do anything, when actually not all of them can. But it offers hope to the ones who may feel limited by their social class. It also exposes the fact that most people try to put up false facades of themselves to hide who they are in order to feel accepted by the social standards we create in our society; it shows characters with this flaw, but ultimately they accept this reality and learn to be true to themselves. This thread, I think, is very common throughout the Pixar films, and they present it very well. ""Ratatouille"" is my new Disney-Pixar favorite! ""Ce film a pleine de joie de vivre!""","

"Ratatouille","DICK STEEL","10 August 2007","The Pixar juggernaut continues! I've always been enthralled by the movies that Pixar puts out ever since Toy Story, and through the years, Pixar has built a brand of trust amongst movie goers, with quality storytelling using animation as a tool to tell them, not because it's cool to do things through the medium, but that it adds a certain powerful, believable dimension, with stories rooted to universal themes, yet jazzed up by the structure in which it's told. The Incredibles ranked amongst my favourite so far, but writer-director Brad Bird has topped that with Ratatouille, a story about a rat, and probably the most mature of the Pixar stories to date.One of the rare successful rats in the animated genre is Mickey, but Remy here (voiced by Patton Oswalt) has more character, and with that photo realistic quality to him, will give Mickey a run for his money. It's a class act story about a rat who dreams of being somebody, of wanting to follow that dream in becoming a chef in Paris, and is undeterred by his size, and well, form, even though in any kitchen, the last thing you want is a rat in it. And to realize his dream, he forms a symbiotic friendship with bumbling Linguini (Lou Romano), a garbage boy who just joined the restaurant which Remy's idol, the late renowned chef Gusteau (Brad Garrett), founded.It's a story about the tussle between friendship and family, with the latter providing an added emphasis, and you'll happen to just about find a familiar chord to it. Remember the time when your folks frown upon the friends you keep, and how sometimes, through their good intentions, unwittingly stifle your hopes and desires? Or how family becomes that obstructing stone on the pathway to success, or being taken for granted to provide for greedy, unabashed family and so-called friends? Ratatouille explores these and more, though they're kept veiled and subtle for the narrative to move on, and never provided a dull moment for kids and adults alike.Pixar's animation continues to astound, and provide inspiration to the many 3D animators out there - they have always set new benchmarks for others to follow, and I think they're on top of their game with the excellent animated portrayal of Paris, the kitchen, and of course, the rats, with that touch of photo realistic quality to it all, which does wonders to the food presented. Amongst the food, I like the crusty breads best - you can almost feel the texture, and the rustling sound is just to die for. And the cheese, you can just feel it melt in your mouth. Mmm mmm!The story's adversaries might be familiar - a mean boss Skinner (Ian Holm) and a mightier- than-though food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole), but it's the latter, despite his shorter screen time, that does its best to chill, and it was such an obvious jab with making him English. The comedy's here top notch, not necessarily relying solely on slapstick to bring on the laughs, but possessing many sly moments throughout as you root for little Remy and his escapades, less so for Linguini though, who comes off as that perfect loser in life.Ratatouille is a perfectly delicious offering worthy of that Pixar stamp, and definitely gonna be a crowd pleaser. I'm not sure why the delay in getting it released here, and having to suffer watching poor quality animation along the way. But the wait is well worth it, and I bet everyone will be pleasantly surprised indeed, with all the ingredients coming together for that wonderful presentation, that tastes and looks ju st wonderful. Despite the overkill of trailers, pre-screening warnings to turn off your mobile phones, etc, continue to put your trust in that little rat Remy, and savour what Ratatouille has to offer. No regrets - highly recommended, and another contender for my top movie of the year listing.Ratatouille is preceded by the trailer for the next Pixar movie Wall-E, and a short Pixar featurette titled Lifted, about two aliens and one of their attempts in passing the Alien Abduction course. Stay throughout the animated end credits for a little coda at the end.","

"Ratatouille","bobsgrock","22 January 2008","The greatest test of whether or not a film is truly admirable is how well it holds up years after its release. It has been almost three years since Ratatouille has been released and I have now seen it at least four times, maybe more. I am proud and thrilled to say that it has not lost any of its charm, still looks amazing and holds up better than almost any film I've seen as many times as I've seen this.It's hard to put your finger on, but why exactly is Pixar able to create these astonishingly good films that aren't just entertaining and delightful, although they certainly are that. They are able to tap into the very realms of the human condition, and with this bring to the surface emotions and feelings you come to not expect from an animated film because after all, animated automatically infers a film for children.Of course Ratatouille breaks that mold and I am just so pleased that I got caught up in the world of Remy once again. With their endless budget from Disney, Pixar can create and explore any aspect necessary and writer/director Brad Bird does just that. The story here comprises elements of drama, sadness, family relations, job pressures, as well as a wonderful monologue near the end by a critic for critics. The story is pitch-perfect, always understandable and the foundation for which the film is made.And, since it is Pixar and Disney, the look and feel of the film is so engrossing, it looks better than other animated films made after it. One of the things Pixar does so well is find the middle ground in making elements of the frame look real but not too real, thus still maintaining an animated universe. They did it with the water in Finding Nemo, the cars in Cars, and they do it here with the food, which at times looks so real you want to taste it.I really can't say anything bad about Ratatouille. Even the story elements of how Remy and his human counterpart, Linguini, are able to work together work because this is the animated world which lends itself to more freedoms than our world. The voices are terrific from Patton Oswalt to Ian Holm to the great Peter O'Toole as deathly-thin food critic Anton Ego. There really isn't anything here that doesn't work and Michael Giacchino's score emits the spirit of Paris that sets the background for this story. This is just a great film, perfect in its story, its characters and the wonderful, vibrant world it creates. Years after its release, Ratatouille continues and will continue to impress and immerse viewers in a touching story with beautiful surroundings about the cutest rat in the world becoming a chef in Paris. Only animation, and only Pixar, could make this a film and succeed.","

"Ratatouille","Galina_movie_fan","17 February 2008","When ""Ratatouille"" (2007) was released last summer, I was not too eager to see the animated 106 minutes long film about a rat in a kitchen of a five-star Parisian restaurant. The idea seemed too original and brave for my taste. As film had been shown all over the world, I kept reading and hearing only great reviews for it. Then, my brother who usually does not get exited about any movie, told me that ""Ratatouille"" was absolutely charming, captivating, funny and moving at the same time, and the most charming about it was Remy, a rat, ""little chef"" with huge talent in the fine art of cooking. I saw the movie last weekend and I am happy to agree with my brother completely. ""Ratatouille"" has everything for every viewer to enjoy - technical excellence, amazing colors, highly original images, and the voices that matched the characters perfectly. The film is a clever satire and the moving story that will be interesting for the adults and children alike. Where the movie succeeds admirably - in showing on the screen the process of cooking which can be as inspiring and creative as painting, writing, or composing the music: ""How can I describe it? Good food is like music you can taste, color you can smell. There is excellence all around you. You need only to be aware to stop and savor it."" Speaking of how the movies sometimes affect our life - after we saw ""Ratatouille"" together with my husband, he demanded that I cooked him a Ratatouille that would take him back to his happy childhood days and rock him to his core just like the one that Remy prepared for a ""grim eater"", the universally feared food critic Anton Ego.Not every year, an animated film is nominated for five Academy awards, and I wish ""Ratatouille"" victories in every category. It deserves them all.","

"Ratatouille","TheLittleSongbird","31 July 2009","I really loved Ratatouille, it was original, sweet and lots of fun. While not as laugh-out-loud funny as the two Toy Story films, it is definitely one of the better Pixars, and a complete delight from start to finish. Honestly, the whole family will find it just as delightful as I did, and the film has a great message ""a great cook can come from anywhere"", summed up perfectly by Anton Ego. The story was highly original, if a little slow at the beginning, and deliciously engaging up to the last minute, and the animation was just spellbinding. The script, while not as irreverent as Toy Story, was very entertaining and touching, and I loved the characters- everyone was likable and unique, but what made Remy stand out for me was because he was so adorable, and his voice actor did a delightful job voicing him. The voice cast were very talented, and all did a superb job, especially Peter O'Toole in a marvellous turn as the ""nasty"" food critic Anton Ego. All in all, a brilliant film, that fully succeeded in what it promised to do, to make us want to cook. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox.","

"Ratatouille","Smells_Like_Cheese","19 July 2007","Another masterpiece from Disney and Pixar, this year they bring us another family classic for generations to come, Ratatouille. My friend and I saw Ratatouille tonite and we just had a blast watching it, this film was such a pleasure and was so funny and cute. I would say that actually this is Pixar's best work, they have come such a long way from Toy Story, it's incredible. But Ratatouille had amazing animation that was so real, makes you wonder if we'll ever need actors in the future, lol. The story is just so charming and a perfect fit for any family to watch, even just to watch this film on your own, I guarantee you will have fun watching it.Remy is a rat with a special gift, a gift of smell, he uses this gift to cook. He's not just any ordinary cook, but an amazing one at that, but when he gets separated from his family, he is haunted by the most famous chef in the world, he ends up in Paris. Where he finds a restaurant that was once grand and has slipped up when it comes to good food. An ordinary garbage boy messes with a stew in the kitchen, when Remy sees this, he helps him out. Linguini, the garbage boy, accepts Remy and together they create masterpieces and bring the restaurant back up. They must keep it a secret how they create these fantastic foods; but that gets so much harder when people try to find out how he's so talented.Ratatouille is such a charming Disney/Pixar film, the animation is great, and the story is just terrific. The actors voices were so great and fit the characters well. If you are looking for a film to see this summer, Ratatouille is definitely a recommendation, it's good to know that Pixar is going to keep giving us these great animation films that I know will be considered classics for a very long time. Ratatouille is delicious, I loved this film.10/10","

"Ratatouille","robcat2075","17 June 2007","I just saw ""Ratatouille"" tonight.It's a first class movie. Several thoughts come to mind...-The character performances are so good, I think there's no sort of movie they couldn't make. I've heard Pixar's John Carter of Mars is going to be live action? No! I want them to do it all animated.-""Cars"" definitely _was_ a lower-value softball they threw to finish out that original Disney-gets-half-of-everything-plus-sequel-rights contract they were in at the time. I remember all the clucking last summer about how Pixar had lost its way.-There were a few moments when they seemed to lose that stylized reality they had established and things looked merely ""real"".-There was one scene in the latter part of the film where I thought ""I can't believe they are doing this tired movie cliché"" but they pulled out of it at the last second and made it something new.-The 2D-ish end credits were great. Stick it out to the very end to see the mo-cap disclaimer!-With this, Brad Bird is certainly one of the animation gods now.","

"Ratatouille","tedg","15 July 2007","Its easy to see how this story came about. Animators are puppeteers first. So if you asked an animator to come up with a story, naturally you will find two features: one would involve two on-screen characters, one the animator of the other. We have many jokes associated with how imperfectly the on-screen animator (our hero) works his puppet at first. Incidentally, this movie is preceded in the theater by a short: ""Lifting."" It features a novice ""animator"" of precisely this type, being graded. Notice the infinite panel of switches in that short.Count on Pixar to find yet another way to fold introspection into the form. This is elaborated by the character of a critic. We see him first in a coffin-like office. He's only capable of destruction it seems. Voiced by Peter O'Toole in a stentorian voice-about-theater, he likes what he sees (tastes). Its a great trick you see. Usually this trick is in the form of an on screen audience watching some sort of climactic performance. When they cheer, we do too, as we become folded into the story.In this case, that is handled by a place made for us and occupied by ""the critic."" So we have a place in the story for the animator and the viewer. What else? We'll need a place for the animation, right? And we have it.It appears first as a book by a now dead, corpulent chef. This book, natch, comes alive. Look how ""Ted's law"" is followed: the distance between the ""real"" world of ourselves and the animated movie is the same as that from the animated movie and the ""living cartoon"" within. Its an explicit fold. And the fact that the inner cartoon has an open, personal feel to it conveys to the personal feel we are intended to have with the Pixar movie.So these three folds: in the story is the story, the animator and the viewer. And the introductory short sets this up too.Having said that, there are a couple noteworthy segments. In terms of the actual craft, Pixar has two areas in which it innovates.One of these in how space is handled. The Pixar guys realized early on that if the three dimensions are going to be modeled anyway, you can zip the camera around in new ways. Early in the game they did this in an overt way. That's been picked up by the summer action films, the best of them, including the Depp pirate business. (Another Disney project benefiting from the eye motion lab.)You can see this throughout the project: there are both all sorts of well managed, unusual perspectives, and a constant overlay of new shots. By this I mean that every shot is just a little different than what you've seen. Just a little canted. A little closer perhaps. A little movement that a physical camera cannot do well.But there are some big production sequences as well. I'm particularly interested in architectural water. Its a unique cinematic challenge. Its not one done well in animation because the mathematics of simply making water look real is daunting. Pixar has done what needs to be done: they have made water hyper-real, dramatic. There's a sequence here that is something like that Pinnochio sequence of 67 years ago with the whale. But its so new and fresh and exciting. Look at the water and see that it has a million tiny agents all seeking to be angry  to do damage but never reaching consensus on just how to attack. This alone is worth the admission.There's another thing that is uniquely Pixar: how characters move. Its a tricky thing, that. As with the water, it is not ever enough that they move realistically. You can make realistic movements by outfitting actors with sensors and translating that to the created beings. It captures nuance. And if you have a particularly skilled source actor, he or she will move not as a real person would, but as an actor would to convey reality. Real isn't real. We need hyperreal in special ways to get- read the reality.The credits of this movie ostentatiously say that """"Our Quality Assurance Guarantee: 100% Genuine Animation! No motion capture or any other performance shortcuts were used in the production of this film."" You can see it. We are entering a new era where both the cameras and the characters can use dramatic motions not possible with human eyes and bodies.Its a challenge for viewers. What do we accept as embodiment? So far, the answer is that the non-natural movements must always be in the service of conveying or seeming natural. But I imagine at the speed this is developing, we may soon see something more.One character note: Colette is voiced by the remarkable Janeane Garofalo. As with our hero, she has that French nose. As the love develops between these two, she becomes decidedly more sexy, both in voice and appearance. Its the appearance that I remark on here. Its all done with postures and a motorcycle. That motorcycle is there in part to allow her to bend forward, and change her lower anatomy. These folks at Pixar are good. Darn good. Glad its Steve Jobs as the creative inspiration instead of that evil other guy.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","

"Ratatouille","fyapar-27303","28 June 2019","In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face is that, in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so...This movie is perfect. This movie is the reason why I write movie reviews. This movie helped me appreciate effort and art. This movie helped me defeat my prejudices against things I don't really know.It is a perfect kids movie, it is a perfect adult movie. Most Pixar movies actually contain very mature messages and this movie's message, ""anyone can cook"" is why we watch movies. Movies are meant to inspire the audience and this movie does a great job. Show this to a kid, they will watch it over and over again. I know because I used to watch this movie every single day.This is not Remy's movie, this is not Linguini's movie, this is definitely not Gusteau's movie. This is Anton Ego's movie. The character development of Anton Ego is phenomenal. We see an arrogant critic become a humble and honest person, and it is what we should become at the end of the day. Most of us start out as arrogant and we do not appreciate effort and talent. However we must learn to give credit where it is due. We see Ego's journey in becoming this modest person, he changes for the better.The final scene is one I cannot praise enough. Seeing Ego complete his arc This movie is an inspiring masterpiece, something we really need in the movie industry today.Maybe I highly rate this movie because of my memories watching it. The scene where he tastes the ratatouille is exactly how I felt re-watching this movie. When I rewatched this movie I experienced something new, an appreciation of kids movies and their messages. This movie changed my whole perception on animated movies. Today, most movies are cash grabs produced with the sole purpose of making profit from tickets and action figures. We need more movies like Ratatouille in this world. In this critic's opinion, this movie is nothing less than the finest movie in history.","

"Ratatouille","Tripper27","17 June 2007","I checked out a sneak preview of Ratatouille last night, and I must say I truly loved this movie. Everything from the animation to the score to the voice acting to the story (and especially the story) was EXCELLENT.I don't know if it appeals to kids as much as other Pixar offerings, but this one upholds their legacy of excellence.Casting Patton Oswalt as Remy was PERFECT. The rest of the voice cast was outstanding as well...including Pixar ""house voice"" John Ratzenberger. See if you can tell which guy he is without foreknowledge (as in, don't read the cast list).Michael Giacchino's score was as perfect for this story as the award-winning one he created for ""The Incredibles"" and the incredible music he has created for most of J.J. Abrams' recent projects, including ""Alias"" and ""Lost"". Even with my 3-year-old son making it really hard to concentrate, and our ""we got to the theater late and had to sit up front"" seats, this movie was fantastic. Everyone should go see it, even if they don't have kids.Brad Bird - you done right by us movie fans again...Ratatouille is great!","

"Ratatouille","DjfunkmasterG","29 June 2007","Ratatouille, the new Disney/Pixar CGI animation film currently sweeping the cinema circuit around the globe. Pixar known for so many CGI animation classics manages to keep churning out winner after winner, and here with Ratatouille they manage to hit a home run, scratch that... a grand slam.The story is not only funny, but also touching in that it reminds to never forget about the people who helped you get where you are and that family whether related or not is important.The main premise is about a rat named Remy whom has the gift to cook. A connoisseur of fine food, Remy manges to help a bumbling garbage boy with no self confidence become the talk of Paris by using him as his personal mechanism to prepare Paris' finest cuisine. However Remy has a dilemma, now that he has risen to stardom, he also has his family who tries to bring him back to the colony because of their distrust for humans, and once Remy's human robot begins to let the fame and fortune go to his head, it becomes a matter of personal resentment he himself must overcome given he is the main cause of the problem, and also the source of the solution.Out to get Remy is the current head chef of the famous Gusteau's, Gusteau's once Paris' famed 5 star restaurant, has now become a 3 star tourist attraction because a snobbish food critic feels the food served is not even good enough for peasants. Once word of the fine food hits the papers the critic himself has to find out how Gusteau's made this triumphant comeback.Ratatouille has tons of laughs, excitement and mayhem. The jokes are truly and mainly adult oriented with a sprinkle of moral lesson mixed in for the kiddies. Although G-rated Ratatouille does go onto to be a bit racy at times, but really it is having fun poking fun at the French Culture without insulting the legacy.Director brad Bird, best known for his hit The Incredibles manages to bring the element of family and trust front and center while engaging the audience in one of the most entertaining animated films since The Lion King. Ratatouille shines as Pixars greatest achievement from beginning to end, and is worth double the admission price for the story alone.I challenge anyone to say this isn't Pixars finest film yet.9 out of 10.","

"Ratatouille","BigWhiskers","17 January 2008","My only regret is that I let this movie slip by without seeing it on the big screen. It's not even playing in those cheap theaters that charge a buck after the movie has been out for a while. I picked up the DVD and watched it 3 times. Remy is adorable and I fell in love with him ,his facial expressions and body language are so sweet, you care what happens to him,there is one scene where he is trapped in a jar and Linguini is going to drop him in the water,you can see the fear in his eyes and how vulnerable he is,it pulls at your heart and you want to just rescue him and take him into your arms. Once the kitchen show gets going though it really rocks.. Linguini is hilarious and Colette a wonderful tough lady chef who falls in love with Linguini. Hijinks in the kitchen as both Remy and Linguini pull off the most hilarious illusion of cooking with Remy pulling his hair to make him do things and Linguini's incredible Jim Caerryesque slapstick bodygags. The supporting cast is equally marvelous with various big stars doing voiceovers like Brian Dennehy ,Peter O'Toole and others adding to it's charm. I'm usually OK with most animated Disney movies that have come out lately but this one really moved me and I'm a 42 y/o man. It was very adult in nature since it appealed more to the older crowd then just kids. I do hope they do a sequel as I would most like to see what happens to Remy next. Bravo Brad Bird and the cast and crew . 10 out of 10","

"Ratatouille","dasa108","25 November 2022","It is one of the best animations of all time. And the reason for this statement is the general charm and attractiveness of the characters. It is a film capable of transporting you to the world of the protagonists and experiencing together with them an adventure of self-discovery, triumph, failure and glory. It has humor, excellent music, great design, excellent voice casting, and some sequences that will go down in animation history. A great film is one that can stand the test of time and that despite being several years old, nothing has been made that can surpass it in quality or emotion. It is a film that meets the simplest requirement of cinema: to entertain. And the latter does it very well.","

"Ratatouille","snorlax3111984","24 July 2007","Today I had the privilege of seeing Pixar's 8 feature-length release, and the current front-runner to receive the 2007 Best Animated Oscar.That film is Ratatouille. It revolves around Remy an adorable little rodent who desires to be a great chef, and Linguine, a bumbling but well-intentioned nerd who helps Remy become a great chief. The movie begins in a French country-side house where Remy and his disapproving rat brethren (""shutup and eat your garbage"" says Remy's father when Remy complains about wanting high-quality food) are driven away by a miserable elderly French hag. Through his escape from the French hag, Remy lands in a Parisian restaurant created by a famous French chef named Gusteau. Gusteau took his own live after a bad review from a famous food critic named Anton Ego, but Gusteau still appears in Remy's imagination to offer various pieces of advice, such as ""anybody can cook"" and ""stealing is wrong"". Through Gusteau's inspiration and Linguini's bumbling nature, Remy and Linguini become cooks in a partnership that may bring Gusteau's restaurant back to it's former glory. Complicating matters are a feisty female cook, an asshole of a head chef, the reunion between Remy and his disapproving family, and snarling food critic Anton Ego.Do not be afraid of Ratatouille's 110-minute running time, this movie has a far-quicker pace that some 90-minute movies. If you are a kid, you'll love the Looney Tune-esqe slapstick. Through accident, Remy can control Linguini like a puppet by pulling on his hair. It's a real thrill to see Linguini make body motions that are completely against his will. If you are older, you will appreciate the message this movie provides: no dream is too important, if you work hard enough and never stop believing you can achieve anything. This not the first time that message has been told in an animated film, but it's a lesson that's worth repeating. That is not the only thing this movie has to tell us. Like Remy, we as humans must decide whether to go our own way or do what our family tells us. We must also decide whether it's better to be respected doing things that make us miserable or to be disrespected doing things that make us feel happy. Not since Amadeus has such an enjoyable movie asked such serious questions.I left this movie feeling really wonderful and enchanted. Enchanted because I saw the good guys get what they deserve, enchanted because I saw the jerks get what they deserve. I felt enchanted because I witnessed the marvelous performance of Peter O'Toole as the crusty but lovable food critic Anton Ego. The way Peter O'Toole used the word ""Perspective"", I couldn't help but get goosebumps, and I mean that as a high compliment.While I still await The Simpsons Movie with great anticipation, now I highly doubt it will win the Best Animated Feature Oscar, because it'll have to be really good to beat Ratatouille's magic.My grade (out of 4 stars): 4","

"Ratatouille","jaredmobarak","23 July 2007","Brad Bird is by far the best writer/director of animated films coming out of America in a long time. Besides a Hayao Miyazaki, there is no one else with the track record that this guy has. From The Iron Giant to the Incredibles to now Ratatouille, Bird just gets better and better with each new move. This new Pixar installment is definitely the most intellectually stimulating yet, but really which of his films haven't been intelligent first, kiddie-catering second? Ratatouille is by all means cinematic in scope and execution. There is nothing to this movie that screams animation besides the fact that it is a cartoon. The characters are all well fleshed out with emotions and inner struggle to survive the lives they want at the expense of that laid before them. Each frame is also composed with a sense of cinematography for real life. The expanses of Paris are breathtaking to behold and many camera movements stay within the constraints of a true machine there to capture the action. Bird's world on display is all encompassing and you will be fully immersed into the tale, no matter what age, because it never loses its integrity or ability to surprise with its never ceasing authenticity.Pixar will always be at the top of the computer graphic echelon because they have never catered to the increasing trend of dumbing down to the lowest common denominator. It appears that the current trend in America has been to try and make everything too equal, thus simplifying things in order for those less motivated souls to understand and laugh at, at the expense of the intellectuals which should be allowed some intellectual stimulation as well. Rather than go for the ""fart jokes"" and clichéd old-hat humor, Disney's newly bought animation studio has proved time and again that story is paramount and that without it, no means of skill or effects can survive. Locking up a talent like Bird for his most recent two films shows the dedication they have in getting the right people involved in the creative process. The backbone impetus of this story is not at all truly original. It is very much an ugly- duckling type tale of someone who has decided to go along a path different then his people have for generations. While being slightly ostracized at home, he goes into the world in order to find meaning and a use for his extraordinary skill. Since that skill is a keen sense of smell, what better occupation than gourmet chef is there for mixing those flavors at his service in unique and wonderful ways? Unfortunately, our hero is a rat, and we all know that they don't go with hygienic kitchens very well. He must find a kind soul to help him do what he was born to do, and with that fateful meeting in Gusteau's restaurant, our tale unfolds. By going against the stealing mentality of his fellow rats and living amongst the humans, I was starting to think we would eventually get to a point where his clan speaks of how he has angered the rat Gods and their supply of garbage has been cleaned up by environmentalists around Europe. I quickly hit myself in the head, remembered that this wasn't Happy Feet with rats, and sat back to enjoy a real fairytale story that didn't try to shove an agenda down my throat. Fairy tales tell of morals and happiness and originality succeeding over prejudice and Disney/ Pixar still knows how to deliver.Animation-wise, Ratatouille is a sight to behold. The fur on each rat is as tactile as that on Sully from Monsters Inc. and the liquids on display are gorgeous. Whether sewer water, Parisian streams, or blood red wine, each fluid is rendered with amazing clarity and realism. Even the human characters, something not often attempted by Pixar, are caricatured enough to make them slightly abnormal so that instead of looking at their humanistic flaws, we see them as just other animated creatures in a world of their own. Also, the set pieces are elaborate and highly detailed. The restaurant dining room is fantastically displayed and each swoop through the double doors of the kitchen brings you into a new world beyond the sinks and utensils. Even the underbelly passages of the rats are highly detailed as we go through them fast and furiously while our hero Remy runs to get above ground, going past numerous rooms that are seen through cracksa comically French domestic dispute among them until we get our first glimpse at the grandeur of Paris.Despite the beautiful graphics and the unobtrusively effective voice-overswhen you find you aren't wondering who is who, you know the acting is successfully integrated into the wholeit is the story that really shines. Bird has culled his imagery from many sources, including a bit of what I feel is Tim Burton for the nemesis food critic Anton Ego who eerily reminded me of Christopher Lee, yet has made everything his own. Remy the rat must fight against his heritage and his very being in order to live his life the way he wants to. There is a lot of comedy involved in getting the human Linguini to become his friend and partner on the journey to culinary perfection, but there is even more heart behind it all. We are treated to some nicely quirky supporting roles, but none are ever put to the forefront in order to overshadow the real stars. While not the ensemble these types of films usually are, our leads are strong and never falter to the point you wish we had more of the others. I accepted the terms of the plot early on and never tired of the journey Brad Bird and company led me on. Pitch-perfect at every turn.","

"Ratatouille","jamesnicolay","22 July 2007","To describe Ratatouille as the best animated film ever made is still an understatement. It is a topnotch achievement--the chef d'oeuvres amidst a world of hamburgers and fries.The advanced screening of the latest collaboration of Disney and Pixar, directed by the ingenious Brad Bird, whose previous works were never disappointing (The Iron Giant and The Incredibles), was probably most anticipated by some Filipino viewers who are aware of the increasing popularity and immense critical acclaim of the Ratatouille. To paraphrase a critic, it was even hailed as the ""prophet who spreads and embodies the new age of the world of animation."" As much as I wanted to digress back then, I admit that I was giddy and excited to witness what the fuss is all about. As soon as I heard that there was a two-day advanced screening of Ratatouille, I told myself that I had to see it by hook or by crook.I went inside the theater with extremely high expectations. I was blown away--the film did not disappoint--and the critics were right. BUT more than that, watching Ratatouille is a cinematic experience--I left the cinema shivering and in awe. The last time I had the same experience was with Martin Scorsese's The Departed, the Oscar best picture last year. I won't be surprised if this--yes, animated film--gets the same honor next year. The quality of Ratatouille's animation can be compared without embarrassment to modern paintings or visual art compositions. The texture and the colors of Paris juxtaposed with the vivid outlines of the furs of the rats--combine these with excellent camera movements that follow the world of a rat adjacent to the oh-so-romantic alleys and lights of Paris--these unlikely combinations are beautifully illustrated that the audience is easily enchanted-- transported into the lovely world of Remy and Linguini: the little rat chef and the simple young man who just wanted to get by after losing his mother.The story is focused primarily on Remy, gifted with an extraordinary sense of smell which eventually developed into his keenness and sensitivity to food. That's not a problem at all if he were perfectly a normal human being--Remy is a rat, one of the icky rodents that survive in packs, stealing food, rummaging through your garbage, causing disease and infections. He feels terribly odd about his special gift, often finding himself at the kitchen of human beings, experimenting his own cooking. After a series of unfortunate events, he finds himself lost and away from his family in the sewers--luckily, these sewers are in Paris, practically a food paradise for food enthusiasts. Eventually, he meets Linguini, a recently orphaned young man who turns up at the restaurant of a former famous chef named Gusteau, who happens to be a TV chef idol of Remy during the times he snuck out to the house of humans to get the spices he needed for his cooking. Unlike Remy, Linguini's knowledge of cuisine and food is close to nothing. After being assigned as a garbage boy in the restaurant, at one time, without thinking, he spoiled a soup being prepared for the restaurant's customers. Remy intervenes and saves the soup, which will turn out to be a big sensation soon. The rat is discovered by the young man, the head chef discovers the rat and orders the young man to get rid of the rat. Of course, Linguini cannot get rid of the rat because he needs to know how the rat cooked the sensational soup. So he decides to save the rat and the soup and eventually, everybody's saved. Though that's just the basic premise of the story.The plot is solid, mixing a dash of vintage Disney archetypical hero in Remy (who reminds us of other Disney heroes who just think of themselves as different, who want to go out there, somewhere else where they will be more understood and where they are meant for greater things) and the Pixar's archetypal hero in Linguini, whose real heroism is found lingering among his inner values and natural kindness. But more than this, watching Ratatouille feels like reading a favorite bedtime story for people across all ages.What really amazes me the most is the story's utter simplicity which exceptionally utilizes and combines realism and fantasy in the lovely world of Remy and Linguini. The dialogue is extremely witty, the humor is not forced and most of the times delivered with taste.I can't wait for a second, a third, a fourth helping of Ratatouille. Yes, an original DVD will definitely be worth the entertainment feast that this luscious film offers.","

"Ratatouille","AngelOfPolitik","28 July 2007","Where do I start with this? When I first saw promos for this movie, I was thinking ""Another rat movie!"" After Flushed Away, rat movies just seemed, well, bad. But after the good words from the critics, I warmed up to the idea, but was skeptical.So with my dad, I saw the movie, and boy, were my first thoughts wrong! The animation was spectacular. Some recent CGI films are just plain crud (I want to keep my review clean) in their animation. But this movie, each little bit of the animation was so professionally done. The food looked good enough to eat and the views of Paris were perfect! The acting was great too. Patton Oswalt did a spectacular job with Remy and Peter O'Toole as Anton Ego was one good decision! As for the rest of actors, they did a good job too! It's just that Patton Oswalt and Peter O'Toole stood out the most.So, um, see this movie!

It has many comedy elements but is not overloaded with jokes that make reference to the present time (like Shrek).This movie integrates a very nice story, with attractive characters and the last advances in computer animation. Is a real art work in the sense that it integrates all its elements without oversizing one of them: an inspirational cartoon tale that uses the computer graphics with some elements of comedy.The facial and corporal language of the main characters is amazing.

Peter O'Toole as Anton Ego, the food critic, is also a great performance. The Paris atmosphere mixed in with the irony of a rat being a world class chef is excellent. I find it similar to ""The Menu"", it's just a great movie that kind of flips the idea of general criticism on its head and suggests that most people who nitpick and critique every little thing miss out on a lot of enjoyment of some of the simpler things in life. Also the idea that not everybody, but anybody with enough drive and talent, can achieve greatness. Great animated movie that's not dumbed down or just to throw on something for the kids.","

"Ratatouille","Ch4ndler_B1ng","10 January 2022","In my opinion, Ratatouille is the best Pixar movie ever! The way that it humanizes rats could've easily been misdirected like basically every other animated movie that has animals as main characters, somehow Ratatouille managed to surpass every single other Pixar movie I've seen. I had a long fear of rats, but after watching this movie my fear was suppressed and I realized that these rats are just like us humans - asides from the fact that most of them live in the sewers and don't have easy access to food - the message feels realistic, there is emotional depth, the animation is artistic and it is a visual masterpiece.The voice acting is literally perfect, not one flaw, its' world feels unique and unlike any other Pixar universe. I was enthralled throughout its' entire runtime, from that epic shooting scene in the beginning to the end when Remy finally has his dream of becoming a chef be true, he works alongside Linguini and Colette after the food Remy made with Linguini was approved by Anton Ego himself.It's one of my favorite animated movies ever made, it sends a message that applies to a lot of young people (not just rats) and it's well deserving of its' reception and maybe more.","

People uses to say that the best food in the world is in Paris, more precisely in Gusteau's, and Remy dreams on becoming a chef. On the same day that his idol dies after reading a bad review of the arrogant critic Anton Ego, Remy gets lost from the clan of his father in the sewers and ends in Paris in front of the famous restaurant. Remy does not resist and goes to the kitchen, improving the soap that is being prepared with ingredients and spices. The clumsy garbage boy Linguini receives the credits for the successful recipe; he is promoted to cook and starts a partnership with the little chef. But the greedy chef Skinner is not happy with the success of Linguini that is jeopardizing his future project for Gusteau's.""Ratatouille"" is a delightful animation, with a very funny and original story. It is inconceivable to imagine a rat in the fanciest restaurant of Paris; imagine a rat as a prominent chef, having a clan of rats in the kitchen helping him to prepare sophisticated meals for the upper-class of Paris and a harsh critic of restaurants. Only this sequence would be enough to make laugh. But the story has nice characters and good messages about the importance of making a dream come true and creativity in your work, friendship and loyalty. The story has many plot points and the resolution is great. In the end, I loved this animation. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Ratatouille""","

"Ratatouille","diac228","30 June 2007","The only way this movie could not be enjoyed is if you watch it on an empty stomach. The folks of Pixar deliver what just might be the most complete animated film since Toy Story 2. By complete, we are talking the full course, not just story and humor. With flawless animation, a brilliant score, the best voice talent in ages, an excellent script, a nice story, plenty of humor, a dosage of romance, and a rather surprising amount of realism, and a heartwarming ending, Ratatouille is the best Cinderella story from Disney sinceCinderella. From the director of The Incredibles and from a studio that has delivered hit after hit after hit, it is no wonder why Disney spent so much money purchasing them. This was a tough-to-sell concept executed beautifully, poetically, and just might become the best film of the entire year. The only problem is that this movie sets the bar even higher for animated films from here on out.Ratatouille follows Remy (Patton Oswalt), a rat who wants to become a good cook instead of a good food thief (like his father and co.) and will attempt to do so with his special smelling abilities. After a mishap where he lives, he winds up underneath Paris, close to the restaurant of his mentor, the recently deceased Gusteau (Brad Garrett). Using the garbage boy of the ex-5-star restaurant Linguini (Lou Romano), he attempts to spread his talent of cooking. Conflicts arise when the head chef Skinner (Ian Holm) suspects the sudden rise of fame in Linguini's cooking and realizes his true worth. More conflicts arise when the only female chef becomes romantically involved with Linguini; Remy is having trouble returning to the lifestyle of a rat, and a well-known yet stern critic Ego (Peter O'Toole) decides to make a return into the spotlight.What makes Ratatouille stand tall with some of Pixar and even Disney's best works is the heavily detailed animation, that results in some of the most breathtaking chases and scenes and also results in plenty of concealed visual humor (Check out the structure of Ego's office). From the hairs of the rats to the water flowing to the food that looks good enough to eat, this is Pixar outperforming itself in terms of computer animation. Then we have the best casting since Finding Nemo. Once again focusing more on talent rather than star power, we have an excellent cast of actors and actresses providing the voices. The standout performances come from Peter O'Toole (almost Oscar-worthy), Brad Garrett, Lou Romano, Ian Holm, and Janeane Garofalo.The problem with animated films nowadays is their inability to present a story without having to aim low for a joke or referencing the pop culture of the times. Ratatouille is a living, breathing storybook come to life, and this is thanks to the excellent writing of Brad Bird. Bird combines plenty of conflicts with humor, and also a dosage of realism in terms of the way things are run behind the scenes of a restaurant. Unlike previous summer flicks, Bird perfectly handles the multiple villains in the Cinderella story, which nowadays is a complete rarity (Yes, there is more than one ""villain"" in the tale). Clocking in at just less than two hours, it might be a bit long for tykes but after the rather slow beginning, the movie almost instantly picks up once the setting changes. While the humor isn't as sprinkled as in Nemo or Toy Story, it provides plenty of laughs as well as action, drama, and even a little hint of romance. Linguini as a Pinocchio-like chef provide some of the funniest scenes in the whole movie.There just aren't enough words to describe just what makes this movie work, it is presented and handled with such delicacy, it keeps Pixar at the top of the animation kingdom, much to the disdain of Dreamworks, the other competitors, and even the animators at Disney. To craft a movie this good requires time, patience, attention to detail, and a desire to push the limits of animation and storytelling. There is no harder-working company in the movie industry than Pixar, and it shows with each and every single movie it has come out with since 1995; including some of the best films of all-time like Toy Story, Toy Story 2, and Finding Nemo. If the competitors aren't taking notes right now, it is because they don't desire to be the best.Bottom Line: You can only raise the bar higher so many times before not even yourself can reach it. This is what happened with Cars and Monster's Inc., and movies like Ratatouille are the reasons why. While the pacing and running time may be a turnoff for some, the excellent visuals and flawless storytelling more than make up for it. Like a full course meal, Ratatouille has a little bit of everything and much more. The Disney magic that was present back when Disney was alive is in full blast here, which is something that non-Pixar Disney movies lately have not been able to provide. Stop reading this and go enjoy the movie. Ratatouille just made Cars look a bit inferior as it becomes the best animated movie in years, and is potentially the best movie of the entire year. In a summer of sequels, a charming story about a rat with a crazy dream rises to the top of the quality heap.","

"Ratatouille","verdie","30 June 2007","At this point, Brad Bird is no longer making great animated movies -- he's making great movies, end of sentence.From the standpoint of writing, this one keeps an astonishing number of themes going, creates great multifaceted characters, and maintains believable suspense and motivation, all without ever seeming strained or ""written."" From the standpoint of animation, it's unbelievable. The translucency of a rat's paw, the dented shine of a copper kettle, the complex texture of a crumb of bread, are all rendered with breathtaking accuracy. (And Paris has never looked lovelier -- if the French tourist board didn't subsidize this production, they should have.) From the standpoint of voice acting, it ranges from believable and unshowoffy (unlike the annoying star turns we're seeing in a lot of these days) to the stentorian sneer of the great Peter O'Toole.And, most of all, the character creation and animation is beyond belief. The facial expressions, the unique-to-each-character body movements, the sense of weight and texture are so incredibly closely observed and reproduced that at times I had to work to remember that what I was seeing was animation and not Oscar-caliber acting.If this one doesn't go up in the Best Picture category instead of simply Best Animated Feature, there's no justice in Oscar-land.","

"Ratatouille","Rectangular_businessman","11 June 2010","Pixar never disappoints me: ""Ratatouille"" just like ""Finding Nemo"", ""Monsters Inc."" and ""The Incredibles"", it's a funny and enjoyable animated film that the whole family could enjoy.Directed by the talented animator Brad Bird (Director of ""The Iron Giant"" and ""The Incredibles"") ""Ratatouille, is more simplistic than his other films, but it is still pretty good: The animation is flawless, the characters are likable, the voice acting it's pretty good and the story, despite being somewhat predictable it's quite fun to watch. Peter O'Toole makes a great work as the critic Anton Ego, and the ending is one of the best that I've ever watched in a animated film. This was the best movie of the 2007, and it wasn't overrated. Actually, I think it was pretty underrated. Even if it is a film for kids, the adults can enjoy it as well.","

"Ratatouille","jemps918","25 July 2007","Absolutely adorable! Ratatouille deserves all the praise, ever! Pixar just continues to raise the bar and go beyond our expectations with this heartwarming yet incredibly funny gem of a flick.The level of detail and the rich texture of each scene is mindblowingly impressive. The voice characterizations especially by Patton Oswalt, Brad Garrett and Janeane Garofalo are well-directed accompaniments to the surprisingly earnest story that is sure to appeal to adult audiences as well. The animation and cinematography is amazingly sensitive, not showy at all but instead well motivated, effectively giving the audience a feel of what it's like to be Ratatouille's star, Chef Remy, who just so happens to be a rat.It is difficult not to be smitten by the range of complex emotions and situations as he is torn between his family and his passion for creating culinary masterpieces in a human world where he is despised in by default.Just like the movie's fiercest critic, The Grim Eater, it will be close to impossible not to fall in love with this movie. His character provides a pleasantly unexpected but fitting ending with his final review, and what he says is sure to resonate with critics everywhere. It sure hit the food and film critic in me! After all, it is a unique task, to be passing judgment, and Ratatouille is a creative offering worth going back to again and again.","

"Ratatouille","mstomaso","1 July 2007","Ratatouille is a sweet little film about a Parisian rat with ambitions to become France's top chef, and a young dish-washer who may just be his only hope. The plot takes a number of clever twists and turns and delivers some unpredictable elements, which keep what could have been 'just another Pixar' quite fresh. Setting the film in France, and giving it just a pinch of French absurdist comedy for seasoning was a stroke of brilliance. The voice talent is also quite excellent - especially Ian Holm's ""Chef Skinner"" - who also does a mean Golem impression btw - and Jeanine Garafolo's ""Collette"".I am generally not a big fan of talking animal movies, though purely animated ones are definitely preferable to those that morph real animals. But Ratatouille even does this very differently - the rats can understand our language, but we don't get theirs. And, other than their very military approach to getting things done, and the lead character's odd cooking talent, they generally behave like rats and have rat motivations.The movie is fun and funny and, at times, quite heart-warming. The rats are absolutely adorable and even do their own stunts! The human characters, though less sympathetic, are some of Pixar's best! Recommended for family viewing - kids of all ages.","

"Ratatouille","afdiazr","23 July 2007","Brad Bird really moved me when I saw The Iron Giant, a film I didn't want to see at the time. That little animated feature is simply beautiful and touching. Ratatouille takes that level of emotion to another point. Way higher. Don't think kids won't get it. They're not stupid. I remember going to the movies with my parents (they took me to Abel Gance's Napoleon) and being fascinated by the whole thing, even if I didn't understand the whole idea. This is not a comedy. There are some laughs and everything, but it's something more intelligent and dramatic. It's an astounding and complex film about longing for a different life and trying your own talents. About not to be content with the way things are and to go and challenge everything. Even if you end up empty-handed. Gorgeous animation, great script, wonderful characters. This is how things must be done.","

"Ratatouille","Polaris_DiB","17 July 2007","Okay, first things first: scratch ANYTHING you've read in any review, private, published, online, or otherwise, that worries that children might not be that interested in this movie; the presentation I went to was filled with people of all ages, and they all sat right through the end credits. I'm getting really offended by reviewers' habits of passing off successful character development as something children wouldn't be interested in, as if children don't have the basic cogent powers to understand stories, but even if that were the case, this film is remarkably kinetic and exciting--it even is a little slapstick.But that's just the spice. The meat of the matter is that Pixar has followed up their still-good-but-somewhat-formulaic Cars with something really special, a pretty original movie about a rat named Remy who wants to be a cook and all of the things that get in the way--not just a world disgusted by rats, but a personal life that doesn't support his dream. In positive Pixar land, that means Remy will have to make new friends and discover the value in himself before he's able to ultimately work it all out, but believe me, it's all enjoyable and fun in the process.I've written a few and read a million reviews on various Pixar films, and there's just no way around mentioning the animation. Though computer animation has vastly improved over a very short time and other companies are beginning to reach Pixar's level, Pixar's animation is still distinct and original, and a great mainstream marker with which to base any other animated endeavor. In this case, the motion and energy seems to fill the frame as much deep and far as it does close and personal, and the team has built a world of details. Every Pixar feature seems to be an improvement on the last, and at this point the production company is getting uncannily... real...But what I think I like the most about Ratatouille is the use of Anton Ego, the bleak food critic who presents one of many major challenges of Remy's culinary skills. I can't help but read this as Pixar's comment on criticism itself, and the twist is that when something like this work is made right, it not only pleases the adult sensibilities but gets into the true heart of what entertainment like this is meant for: the child inside. The moment of Anton's food taste is a perfect moment of epiphany, handled well by every trick these master craftsmen know.Ratatouille pleases, and also leaves enough to tidy us over until next year's Wall-E. It's hard to imagine it getting any better, but these guys are strangely good at that.--PolarisDiB","

"Ratatouille","L. Lion","1 July 2007","Ratatouille, Brad Bird's third feature (after the scintillating Iron Giant and The Incredibles) measures up to his oeuvre. It's a fine film with wonderful animation, a charming story, and a slam bang finale that had me laughing. The story, in brief, is that Remy the Rat has the dream (and the talented nose) to be a great chef. Through a series of misadventures, he finds himself in the kitchen of Gusteau's, a former five-star restaurant now clicking over on the reputation of its deceased former owner, the great chef Gusteau, whose ghost (or else figment of Remy's imagination) is mentor to Remy. Remy develops a relationship with the hapless Linguini, a garbage boy in the kitchen with a secret past, and through him begins to return the restaurant to its greatness. If the film has a weakness, it is in the second act. The baddie here is the head chef, Skinner, who is anxious to retain control of Gusteau's in order to launch lines of frozen foods. The problems here are that the main conflicts do not really play out. Once the relationship with Remy is established, Linguini becomes more interested in the only female chef in the kitchen, Colette (voiced by Janeane Garofalo) and for whatever reason begins to treat Remy as an afterthought. Since Remy is his only link to culinary glory, he has to be an idiot to treat the rat this way. Remy's personal inner conflict is based on the fact that he longs to treat humans to new culinary delights, while he is made all too aware of how humans feel about rats. Last, Skinner is concerned that a secret from Linguini's past will loosen his hold on Gusteau's. This is dealt with in the most perfunctory manner - Remy finds out, steals some documents, there is a chase (which is very well done) and then Skinner is out. Skinner never truly develops as a villain anyway, and his performance is probably the least weighty. Remy's conflict about how humans feel about rats never feels authentic. He knew about this all along, and he obtains far too much joy from creating new dishes to ever walk away from Gusteau's once has gotten his foot in the door.However, once Linguini gains control of Gusteau's, and has wowed customers through Remy's genius, comes the big test - Anton Ego, the Simon Cowell of food critics, whose word can make or break a restaurant. He is initially developed as the baddie of the food world, but in fact this character is the heart of the film - he may be terrifying, but in fact he loves food, loathes mediocrity, and is honest. His visit to the restaurant, while Linguini is dealing with a full-scale kitchen mutiny, is the comic and action highlight of the picture. It is one of the best, and funniest, climaxes of any films on screen this year. And to understand how this can be, in a scene where the interaction is primarily between the kitchen and dining room, requires someone to see the film. Peter O'Toole does a superb job in voicing Ego, and his take on the evening, and his discovery about Remy (when he insists on meeting the chef), that he later writes up in his review is one of the most sterling pieces of critical journalism to ever appear in a film, ever. I highly recommend Ratatouille. The performances are terrific, the animation is wonderful, and so what if some parts of the plot drag or are never adequately realized. It is nonetheless a terrific movie.","

"Ratatouille","GSmith9072","17 June 2007","Ratatouille is a major step up from a lot of last year's animated fare, and a vast improvement from last year's Oscar winner for best animated feature. Here we re-discover sweet simplicity amped up with the expected story-telling techniques of Pixar, and here's the kicker, no heavy handed messages hammered in with a drill, but there certainly is a message and it's delivered with subtler grace despite some flaws. Although, aspects to the message are borderline confusing if you over analyze the reality that occurs in the film, but the film doesn't scream for over-analyzation in the same fashion as ""Finding Nemo"". For me, the animation slightly overpowers the story, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. The film is directed, camera-wise, with the same interesting techniques as ""Happy Feet"", but the film has more in store. We get to see the world mainly from Remmy's perspective, and it's visually exciting. The camera-work is what makes the film's physical humor work so well. More on the artistic scheme, the film looks really great. Particularly the lighting stands out. The colors are very lush and detailed; very accurate toward a real city-scape. Then the rat's fur are very impressive, it moves against the wind and gets wet very much like real rat hair. Don't let the detail in the clothes get past you either. The film manages to find a balance between superficial realism and animated characters. The character designs for the humans are marvelous (Bird seems to get much humor out of the smaller villains as seen in the past ""Incredibles"" and the non-Pixar film ""Shrek"") and the rats, while moving a lot like real rats still have acceptable personalities and animated form. So we feel like we're entering an animated world that is fleshy and real. Speaking of such, other animated marvels are the organic forms of the food. As real as the food in the film is, the film rightfully capture the spirit of the plot it pursues. It introduces the viewer into the world of fine-dinning and develops something rare in today's animation, a bleeding heart.Story-wise, that's the only area where I can detect any trace of criticism. I felt at times, dare I say it, that the emotion was a little bit forced. There were just certain times I didn't understand a certain character's frustration. Also, I felt uneasy about the films unusual balance of fantasy and realistic themes, such as how the reactions to rats were carried our toward the end of the film and how it blends into the films major theme and other suspend disbelief occurrences. That lack of coherent continuity gives a writer a lot more flexibility in how to tell the story. In other words, it's kind of a shortcut. But it's an observation that is made up for by other successes in the film. The film very impressively for an animated film delivers some conventional themes with a little more depth (to truly enjoy it, I'd recommend erasing the fact that rats often carry disease from your mind). It's cute without embarrassingly forcing it and unpretentious. The very fact that what makes it work may fly over the heads of small children isn't a reason to condemn it. It's true though that I feel that younger kids may get a little restless halfway though, and not just through my own experience at the theater. however, this is another great film for an older audience to enjoy a simple well told story. As for whether it will have that lasting effect that Pixar films usually carry, only time will tell.","

"Ratatouille","Dingataca","29 October 2007","Disney and Pixar have done it again. They've combined their amusing + universal story, sprinkled on some killer animation, added a dash of perfect voice acting, and sautéed it to make very endearing main character, who will appeal to children and adults alike. The end result has been astounding.Remy (Patton Oswalt), is a small rat with big dreams. Where the other rats have a passion for food, Remy has a passion for COOKING food. He aspires to become like his role model and idol: Gusteau - the best chef in all of Paris. After Remy loses his family, he finds himself face to face with Gusteau's restaurant - which is now slowly losing its 5 Star reputation. Unfortunately for Remy, his hero Gusteau suddenly passed away, leaving Remy pondering on what to do. When Remy bumps into Linguini (Lou Romano), the garbage boy, they set out on an adventure together, to discover themselves, to discover secrets, and most importantly, to discover the art of real cooking.The animation is stunning. It is so realistic that it's unbelievable, every little detail has been perfected, and each twist and turn of the story pulls on your heartstrings.Each actor voicing over does a great job, each one is well suited for their role, especially Lou Romano as Linguini - the chemistry between Remy and Linguini was fantastic! Just with the voice, an audience is able to identify with the characters, and view the superb chemistry these two actors, by just listening to their voices. Either way, it really worked for Ratatouille! In conclusion, Disney Pixar have a new bestseller family film on their list, following Toy Story, Shrek, and Finding Nemo. Ratatouille will earn a place in your heart.","

"Ratatouille","DonFishies","30 July 2007","After last year's horrendously average and overrated Cars, I was unsure how to approach Ratatouille. It looked impressive, and it looked like another great entry into the Pixar/Disney lineup. But then, so too did Cars. But something about Ratatouille struck me as immediate, as something that needed to be seen now and not simmered over later. And thankfully, albeit with a few minor flaws, the film comes out as being just as excellent as I could have hoped.Ratatouille tells the story of Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt), a rat who has a keen sense of smell. So keen, that he outright refuses to eat just about anything that his rat colony/family finds in the dumpsters or just laying around. He is put to good use as the poison checker for the colony, but still chooses to search out good food, and not just anything. He dreams of being a famous chef, but is hindered by the fact that he is a rat.What follows is a bitter sweet story of just finding the place to belong. I will forego the mention of the various subplots and surprises, but I will incur that Remy does meet up with the lousy cook Linguini (Lou Ramano), and the two become partners in cooking at the famous Gusteau's Restaurant (as just about anyone who knows anything about the movie can tell you).Even with its bizarre storyline, and even more bizarre main character, Ratatouille is a treat from start to finish. Never once did I not feel like I was watching something from anyone other than a master storyteller, and even at its most fantastical moments, Ratatouille warms with animated joy at just the thought of continuing the storyline. Unlike many other animated films that go around in circles over its simplistic plot and overused morality tale, Ratatouille takes its moral tale, and wraps it around all sorts of plot elements. Children will love it for how comical and cutesy it is, but the adults will love it just for how layered and dense the story is.What it also packs is a wallop of enthusiasm totally devoid from almost the entirety of Cars. While the former moved along slower than animated movie I have ever seen, and was dull right to its very core, Ratatouille is exactly the opposite. It runs at just the right pace throughout the film, and each and every actor delivers their lines with finesse and conviction. They are devoted to these roles wholeheartedly, and are putting some actual effort into their lines. It may help that the majority of these actors are not big time Hollywood superstars, but what also may help is the fact that they all seem to have an interest in these characters and this story, and are not just in it for the paycheque at the end of the voice sessions. They are all clearly having fun with it. Even Peter O'Toole, who plays the menacingly wicked food critic Anton Ego, seems to be amused by his role.In fact, all of the voice actors do great with their roles. Oswalt gives a great balance of naivety, desire and pathos to his main character. I know there was some trouble trying to market the idea of a rat trying to make it in the human world, but I think Oswalt's voice skills helped greatly flatten this idea out into something great. Ramano also does great as Linguini, giving just the right amount of struggle in his voice to truly make his neurotic character truly interesting. Supporting turns from O'Toole, Brad Garrett, Janeane Garofolo, James Remar, and in particular, Ian Holm, are all very well done, and help make the film truly wonderful. Their French accents are all quite amusing. I also liked the small addition of John Ratzenberger, always a great voice to hear in a Pixar movie.The only thing that harms the film is that it runs too long. Director/Screenwriter Brad Bird had this same issue with his other excellent Pixar film (and Oscar winner), The Incredibles. Both pack in so much, and as a result, drag in places that should be more fairly fast paced. Here, these dragging scenes take place near the beginning (Remy does not meet up with Linguini until at least a half hour into the film), and part-way through the middle. All the elements are there, they just do not all add up into something blazingly fast paced. I can appreciate all of the little things Bird is doing to make the film appeal to more than just the children in the audience, but he almost lost me a few times doing it. A little bit of extra trimming could have helped avoid this problem.The animation on the other hand, is brilliant. There is no other word to describe it. Just the one scene where Remy realizes that he is in Paris, and overlooks the entire Parisian skyline, is enough reason to see the film. It looks fantastic in every scene, and never does the beautifully rendered scenery or characters look any less amazing than they did in the scene before. Pixar has really fine-tuned their style over the years, and it shows in how astonishing these characters look, even down to the minuscule little details like a few stubbly hairs on Linguini's chin. It just looks that realistic.On the whole, Ratatouille is not a perfect film, but it is still far greater than the likes of Cars or even this year's Shrek the Third. It was clearly put together so lovingly, and created with so much care that it cannot be seen as anything less than great. The animation, the story and the voice acting all come together to create what is probably going to be one of the best animated films of this or any year.8/10.","

"Ratatouille","Monotreme02","21 July 2007","Firstly, in almost all of the Pixar films before it, the creators had to create and establish a very specific world: in A Bug's Life it is the world of the anthill, in Monsters Inc it is the alternate monster universe, in The Incredibles it is the sort of retro 1950's-throwback-style world populated by superheroes, and the same can be applied to their other works as well. Ratatouille, on the other hand, takes place within the real-life, contemporary ""human"" world, and thus does not need to establish the physics and dynamics of its own alternate universe  much humour is usually derived from the parallels between it and our real world and from the absurdity of the mechanics of these universes.Another major difference is how Bird treats his themes. Major, educational themes have been the center of most animated movies since the oldest days of Disney and right up through the contemporary Pixar age. But what can more than certainly be said about pretty much all the rest of the Pixar movies is that they never try to hide their messages  in fact, I thought that the over-obviousness and simplicity of the message that appeared in Cars was what made it slightly less-appreciated among other Pixar projects. In Ratatouille, not only is the film absolutely brimming with overlaying themes and messages, but Bird at the same time never lets them take the wheel, and always keeps them looming overhead the actual plot and storyline. Themes such as friendship, loyalty, teamwork, and accepting the different and the unexpected can all be found in the film, but never once does Bird force-feed us his message, and for that I appreciate him all the more.The story itself is of course fantastically executed and an absolute wonder to behold. It's touching, original, extremely clever and just plain fun. It's crazy but never enters the territory of absurd, and we always believe in it. The dynamics between Remy and Linguini are also brilliantly carried out, and they work together so incredibly well. But ultimately, the key to the film's success is the utter believability and realism of its characters. We totally believe in the dynamics between the two and in their own particular character traits and quirks. It's just so well done; and I must also mention that the character of Remy was designed in the most absolutely and utterly adorable, eat-you-up way possible! He just puts a smile on your face every time he wiggles his little nose.The animation in the film is nothing short of revolutionary. It is easily the most incredibly well done and the best looking computer animated film made yet, in every aspect. Images that were once flat back in Toy Story become so realistically alive, it's quite mind-boggling to tell you the truth. The use of focus in the animation is so incredibly spot-on perfect and works so realistically in comparison to how it would actually work in real life, its almost hard to believe that this isn't done in real cameras. Add to that absolutely stunning lighting, colouration and textures, and you get some elements of the film that almost seem completely real  just look for example at the piece of bread near the beginning of the film, or the water in the river or the texture of the cobblestones on the street. It's unbelievable! I usually don't refer to the voice acting in a movie because I feel its redundant, and I'm also not a fan of using big celebrity voices just for the sake of having them, unless they are actually used dynamically in the animated character itself or if they are seamlessly integrated, as they are in Ratatouille. But I must bring up one particular vocal performance in this film that just had me grinning every time his character came on screen and his voice started booming: Casting Peter O'Toole as the voice of food critic Anton Ego was a stroke of genius quite unlike any other voice casting decision in ANY other animated film ever  or at least since the casting of Robin Williams as the voice of the Genie in Aladdin. His voice, instantly recognizable, fits the character of Ego so incredibly well, it's almost eerie. And he of course gives a brilliant performance, creating one of the most humorous characters in the entire film.Ratatouille is another five-star success added to Pixar's already high-standard repertoire. It is just as touching, human, real, convincing and emotional as any other Pixar film, although to its credit Bird makes sure that its major themes and messages aren't too obviously or prominently featured, keeping everything subtle and putting the plot and characters first  which are all equally brilliantly done. The animation is the most vivid, perfect and absolutely beautiful in any animated movie yet, and it all fits in together perfectly with the very sly and unique Pixar sense of humour. I of course expected nothing less from the studio, and am now even more brimming with confidence about their next project, Wall-E, after the slight stumble that was last year's Cars. Easily the best movie yet this summer.","

"Ratatouille","Igenlode Wordsmith","6 October 2007","""Ratatouille"", to pick a culinary metaphor, is, like the curate's egg, excellent... in parts. That is, parts of it are excellent, some parts grate, and a good deal of it is good without being especially outstanding. The film has the disarming forethought to get its riposte against criticism in first, in the person of the critic Anton Ego.But my feelings about this picture are on the whole approbatory, while undoubtedly mixed. I didn't like it as much as ""The Incredibles"", and, thinking back, I wonder how much of that stems from Pixar being simply less comfortable out of the familiar territory of the American suburbs. A good deal of what grated on me was the perceived Americanisms, from the gun-toting granny to the unsubtle nature of the self-help message (and just what is a 'patootie' or a 'burrito' anyway? 'Corn dog' was at least explained...) The use of accents is also somewhat scattershot: the villains (inevitably) are played by English actors, the rat-heroes (inevitably) are Americans, while the one female speaking role is played with a comedy French accent -- as if the characters were not all (presumably) talking French.Pixar's animators have obviously spent a lot of time studying rats, as well as -- I would guess -- researching the professional kitchen. These aren't your classic Disney characters with gloved hands, human bodies, and a token animal head and tail. No-one except the owners of pet rats will care that the depiction massively downplays the importance (and size) of the rats' tails and whiskers: a rat's tail is as long as his body and as strong as an extra limb, while he doesn't so much sniff at things as feel them with his impressive 270-degree array of whiskers. My only other caveat would be that the rats in the film seem to spend an awful lot of their time with ears laid back: a real rat's ears are swivelling radar-dishes, high and round and on the alert, and relocating them for most of the shots to a more 'human' position, low down on the head, has a rather odd effect on the characters' expression.But since I for one am a rat owner, I appreciated the way that Pixar have captured their heels-up scamper and their funny trundling walk, their habit of carrying things with their chins raised, their athletic climbing abilities and above all their superb sense of smell; if anyone could design a new dish for a restaurant simply by sniffing it, it would undoubtedly be a rat! I also appreciated the fact that the rats in this story can't actually talk to the humans -- in fact, there's one shot towards the beginning that makes it plain that all they hear is squeaking. This isn't, as it might have been, the story of a boy who can magically converse with animals; rats and humans have to learn to communicate without words. (It's a tribute to the plot that it didn't even occur to me until after the film was over that it was in any way odd that the rats, on the other hand, could not only understand but read every word the humans used!) The process by which Remy discovers that he can remote-control Linguini is, I suppose, ridiculous in a real-life context, but seemed to make sense at the time...Plot-wise, I found the start of the film fairly slow, with all the emotional depth of your average Mickey Mouse, though I did like the concept of the rats' having an organised escape plan. The main picture was preceded by a brief short centred around the quintessential US theme of alien abduction, which had the young audience in stitches but which I'm afraid I failed to find funny in the least -- slapstick cruelties were never my thing -- and this may have jaundiced me.Things looked up once Remy reached Paris, although I found the heavy moral emphasis on the theft of a crumb absurd from a rodent view: how else can a rat eat? Plough his own fields, sow his own wheat, set up his own bakery? In the context of the rest of the story, ""Don't foul your own nest"" might have been more apt than ""Thou shalt not steal"".The turn of events by which Remy becomes an undercover cook is effective, funny and strangely plausible, and from this point the film's quality remains fairly consistent throughout. One bonus is that there is no quasi-obligatory zany sidekick character; the nearest this film comes is in the shape of Remy's brother, and he doesn't get much screen time. But then generally speaking I didn't care much for the 'family' scenes. They mostly seemed to consist of spelling out moral messages in letters a yard high, plus the usual father-son bond fixation.Towards the end the film makes some brave choices, and it is at this point that it rises into the category of 'excellent' and gains some actual emotional depth. It doesn't stop with the fairy-tale ending of the rightful heir, nor yet with the victory over the ogre. The name of the film turns out to be highly significant after all, and our heroes are rewarded not by a pinnacle of magic inheritance, but with fruits of their own earning. A warning: there are some scenes at this point that may be genuinely distressing to young children... as opposed to the cartoon violence of the opening, at which they merely roared with laughter...The pictures of dead rats -- far more realistic than the cartoon-type characters -- I myself found very hard to bear because one of my own pets had died the previous day; the half-open mouth and fragile, curled limbs were the last I'd seen of her, too. I didn't weep when I buried her body, but there were several places during this film about rats when I missed her horribly. Which is, I suppose, a salute to its success.","

"Ratatouille","lucasaq-1","30 June 2007","Leonard Maltin in his glowing review of this Ratatat film calls Pixar, ""a class by themselveswho have carved a niche for itself like no other."" I agree completely. Every one of Pixar's films have an amazing quality which haven't been broken so far as yet. On top of being an animation studio at the pinnacle of greatness, Pixar also has to offer the best time at the theater with their shorts always preceding their films. Thus they offer a full night at the movie theater not seen since the classic days of cinema.Ratatouille did practically the impossible for me. It matched and even exceeded most of my expectations. It had humor, a great story line, and moral message about being all that you can be and not being afraid to succeed or tell the truth. On top of that, it had some of Pixar's best animation to date. The views of Paris are exquisitely detailed and the details of the kitchen fantastic. But even more so the characters most especially the rats have a great look and feel to them that make them lovable even though they are well rats.The story revolves around Remy, a rat with a keen sense of smell and taste who can't stand his life as rat which in his mind is equivocal with a thief. Remy draws strength from ads he sees of a famous cook named Gusteau. Although Gusteau is dead, he draws strength from him and even has an invisible friend in this Gusteau in his own mind. Gusteau then becomes basically a way for the audience to see the inner workings of the mind of Remy. Things really take off for Remy when he is separated from his family of rats and runs into the garbage boy of Gusteau's who can't cook, but is willing to work with the talented Remy to gain a name in Gusteau's restaurant. Neither have it easy as Linguini, the garbage boy, is looked down upon by the scheming master cook of Gusteau's, but a good villain is always needed even if he isn't a completely bad fellow. Another antagonist for our heroes is Anton Ego, a critic of the highest quality who sunk Gusteau establishment in the first place leading to Gusteau's early death. Ego isn't a true villain and has interesting depth, but what else can be expected of a character voiced by aging legend Peter O'Toole.Ratatouille is another gem from the Pixar studio and not likely to unsaddled as the best animation the year. In fact this is among Pixar's best ventures yet.Note: Fantastic exotic score by Michael Giacchino which evokes that Paris style.","

"Ratatouille","Jay_Exiomo","16 July 2007","In a season virtually filled to the brim with disappointing follow-up installments, Pixar Animation Studios and director Brad Bird cook up yet another winner in ""Ratatouille,"" a story of a rat named Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt) who hankers to hone his improbable talent of mixing the right ingredients to make a delightful fare. The members of his colony don't recognize his passion, if not entirely against it, especially his father (Brian Dennehy) who constantly reminds him that humans are dangerous. But as someone who looks up to the late Chef Gusteau, Remy believes what the celebrated culinary expert believes: anyone can cook.But an attempt to prove this to his brother Emile (Peter Sohn) causes him to separate from the other members of his colony, eventually ending up in Paris, and in Gusteau's once five-star restaurant. Now reduced to three stars, it's run by Chef Skinner (Ian Holm), a collusive restaurateur who plans to use Gusteau's prestigious name to sell mass-marketed frozen foods. A series of events bring Remy and Linguini, a bumbling garbage boy working at the restaurant, together. Driven by Remy's desire to cook and Linguini's desperate effort not to get fired after a kitchen mishap, the two team up to prepare the restaurant's new menu items that has the elites of Paris appreciating the restaurant again.Soon, Linguini gets all the credit Remy deserves and Remy's loyalty to his family members are questioned, eventually leading to some sort of a falling out between the two even as renowned food critic Anton Ego is set to do a review of the restaurant.""Ratatouille"" is firstly a sight to behold (ah, Paris!) and praising Pixar for it seems as effective as calling a fast food restaurant unhealthy. It just is. What really sets the studio's projects apart from other films of its nature (I'm consciously trying to keep myself from labeling animation as a genre; you know, Brad Bird... ) is how their stories successfully embed genuine motivations to their characters while adding nice blend of drama and humor, without resorting to an overkill of pop culture references.I understand Disney's dilemma, though, in marketing this film. Save for the fact that it's an animated movie featuring a talking rat, Bird's follow-up to his equally laudable ""The Incredibles"" is placed in such a sophisticated setting with a tad too many culinary jargon which younger audiences might not easily appreciate. In fact, it seems it might appeal to parents more than to their kids. But it's paced well, is thoroughly engaging, and the cast provides memorable voice performances that the movie overall is a, well, delicious experience. In the end, ""Ratatouille"" is a visually pleasing, touching and humorous tale that further proves Pixar and Bird a formidable combination.","

"Ratatouille","rozaliaszopa","20 November 2022","When I was a child Ratatouille was my favorite animated movie and to be honest, still it is. I think Pixar teaches us through its morals a lot of useful things in its movies. In Ratatouille for example we should respect animals and don't treat them worse because they have feelings too. Maybe they can not talk but they are still living beings and our friends who sometimes need our help. Rats don't belong to favorite animals in people's opinion but they are animals too and this is not their fold how they were created.I like this film for its French atmosphere and that was created very interesting and pleasant. Rats were shown in that film friendly. The animation was done very cleverly. If anyone is wondering if this movie is worth watching, I definitely say yes!","

"Ratatouille","ackstasis","16 September 2007","In the last decade or so, beginning their incredible run with 'Toy Story,' we've come to expect nothing less than masterpieces from Pixar studios, and they've rarely  if ever  disappointed us. My favourite Pixar animated feature to date would probably be 'Monsters Inc.,' followed by 'A Bug's Life,' with the remainder of their CV not dwelling too far behind. Nobody in their right minds would consider producing a children's film that featured rats lurking around kitchens, and yet, not only is director Brad Bird in his right mind, but he's also made it work. Welcome to the beautiful city of Paris, France  the food capital of the world - where a young and aspiring rat named Rémy (voiced by Patton Oswalt) dreams of becoming a first-class chef, despite the complete lack of support from his family and human beings' natural aversion towards rodents. Welcome to 'Ratatouille.'At the heart of every great Pixar film is a fantastic story, often simple but always funny and touching. 'Ratatouille' (pronounced, we are told, ""Rat-a-too-ee"") teaches us to always pursue our hopes and dreams, whatever obstacles or limitations are placed in our way. It was directed by Brad Bird ('The Incredibles'), who took over from Jan Pinkava in 2005. Though the plot is perhaps just a tad predictable, the screenplay is beautifully written, with an abundance of funny one-liners and colourful characters. Whilst Rémy refuses to eat nothing less than the best, his older brother Émile (Peter Sohn) will gobble down any garbage he finds, and his father (Brian Dennehy) assigns Rémy  due to his uncanny ability to smell the ingredients in any food  to become the colony's resident poison-sniffer. When Rémy fails in his attempt to steal fine herbs from the kitchen of a crazy old lady, he becomes separated from his family. The legendary but recently-deceased chef, Auguste Gusteau (Pixar regular Brad Garrett), who had inspired Rémy with his motto ""anybody can cook!"" appears before the rat as a shadowy figment of his imagination, offering him guidance and advice.Thus, Rémy stumbles his way into Gusteau's fine-dining restaurant, now managed by the devious Skinner (Ian Holm). A lot of the physical comedy in the film comes from Linguini (Lou Romano), the garbage-boy at the restaurant, with whom Rémy reaches a tentative arrangement: by hiding himself beneath Linguini's hat and controlling his movements by yanking at tufts of his hair, Rémy will be able to demonstrate his expertise for food preparation. But will he be able to accomplish this without arousing Skinner's suspicion? And can Linguini successfully win over meat and poultry chef Colette (Janeane Garofalo), the most aggressive cook in the kitchen? Of course, they must then contend with Paris' most-dreaded food critic, Anton Ego, voiced with great relish by cinema legend Peter O'Toole.Visually, 'Ratatouille' is a masterpiece. Of course, there still remain huge innovations to be made in the field of human animation, but the rodents themselves look absolutely fantastic. An early scene, in which a huge group of rats charge frantically towards the river, looks so incredibly realistic that I pity any audience member suffering from musophobia. Additionally, the nighttime panoramas of a brightly-lit Paris are nothing less than magnificent, with every minute detail of the city painstakingly translated onto the screen. The film is an exciting blend of comedic and dramatic scenes, and elaborate action sequences, each executed with care and patience. The foods all look delicious, as well. The scene in which the ruthless Anton Ego is rendered speechless by Rémy's delicious serving of ratatouille niçoise is handled exceedingly well, and I must admit that a tear came to my eye when the ""peasant dish"" swept the sullen critic back to his glorious and almost-forgotten childhood. I don't think the friends I brought along to the cinema would agree with my assessment, but 'Ratatouille' is undoubtedly one of the finest films of the year.","

"Ratatouille","MaxBorg89","21 August 2007","After the partial disappointment of Cars, which was good but not enough by Pixar standards, it is a joy to see the company return to form. In fact, Ratatouille could even be the best picture they have produced so far, beating The Incredibles, Nemo and even Toy Story.The film wasn't actually as heavily marketed as previous Pixar achievements, possibly because audiences, both young and adult, wouldn't really know what to think of this peculiar movie, which stars a rat. Yes, that's correct, a rat. The rodent's name is Remy (Patton Oswalt), and he is endowed with a particularly powerful nose, which allows him to tell what kinds of food are good or bad based on the smell. This has made him extremely picky when it comes to his diet, and during one of his culinary expeditions he is accidentally separated from his family. After traveling in the sewers for a while, he finds himself in the middle of Paris, the capital of excellent cooking. His joy is only temporary, though, as he discovers that his favorite restaurant (he has seen it on TV) has lost three of its five stars, the first because a nasty food critic named Anton Ego (Peter O' Toole) gave the place a more negative review than usual, the second because the leading chef, Gusteau (Brad Garrett), died of grief. Now the restaurant is in worse shape than ever, as new boss Skinner (Ian Holm) is simply interested in business and doesn't care about the food's quality. Fortunately, Remy, despite being a rat, has taken Gusteau's motto (""Anyone can cook"") to heart and, guided by the great chef's ghost, he tries to bring things back to normal, finding an ally in the clumsy but good-hearted Linguini (Lou Romano), through whom he manages to prepare one delicious dish after another, restoring the restaurant's reputation.The premise might sound far-fetched even for a Disney/Pixar movie, and yet Ratatouille has the best script made for an animated feature in ages: staying faithful to the company's belief that story and character come first, not celebrity voices and pop-culture references (as is the case with Dreamworks' cartoons), writer-director Brad Bird, the man behind The Incredibles), has crafted a screenplay of rare (for a 'toon, that is) sharpness and intelligence, consisting of an intriguing plot, smart gags (including one midway through the movie that should be inappropriate in a G-rated picture but somehow fits neatly into the pitch-perfect narrative) and, most of all, fully developed characters. Whereas most animated films focus on a limited group of people, Pixar has always been famous for giving everyone a moment in the spotlight, and it shows the most in this film: the bond between Remy and Linguini, which is every bit as solid and compelling as the ones between Woody and Buzz or Mike and Sully, is of course at the center of the picture's events, but the initially awkward, then tender relationship between the inept aspiring cook and his coworker Colette (Janeane Garofalo) is equally well built and moving; supporting characters such as Remy's brother and father, who are incapable of understanding his love for proper food, the mischievous Skinner or psychotic cook Horst (voiced by Will Arnett, best known for the hilarious, prematurely canceled Arrested Development), who always has a different explanation for why he used to be in prison (it ranges from ""I created a hole in the Ozone layer over Avignon"" to ""I killed a man... with this thumb!""), provide most of the situation's foolproof humor; as for Ego, to whom O' Toole lends one of the best voices ever to have been used in animation, he stands out as one of the best villains in animated film history (that the makers of such critically adored movies decided to use a critic as the bad guy is another stroke of genius).Also fundamental is the originality: apart from the obviously unusual pitch (rat turns out to be best chef in France), Ratatouille is a gold-mine of superb material from the splendid start to the exceptional ending, which revives Pixar's trademark surprise element that was missing in Cars. The real surprise, however, is the amount of stuff Bird comes up with in between: most movies, especially action flicks and comedies, run out of ideas at a certain point but keep going because otherwise the running time would be too short (this is evident in the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels which, albeit funny and exciting, were famously, and obviously, written as the shooting went on); in Ratatouille, whenever a joke has run its course it is immediately followed by one exactly as brilliant, thus making the film a seemingly never-ending flow of wit at its sharpest.Bottom line: after a a partial misfire, Pixar is, thankfully, back on track with the only film that is capable of rivaling The Simpsons Movie as the best animated feature of the year, and that is really saying something.","

"Ratatouille","lambiepie-2","1 July 2007","Ah, to be an apprentice at Disney --- and to come full circle. Brad Bird is that person and for all of those who are out there that think the odds are against them in such a dog-eat-dog world of entertainment, just mapping Brad Bird's career and his latest installment of Ratatouille should make you get up and not allow anyone to stop you from what you can do! It doesn't matter how old you are, Ratatouille is the film you have to see this summer. It is cute, funny, refreshing...in this summer of big money sequels. And to coin a key scene from this movie -- watching Ratatouille took ME back to a time when I was six or seven years old watching Walt Disney Films on TV when Walt oversaw the studio. Ratatouille is a film done in the tradition of the Walt Disney Company -a well thought out, family film with hope, an unlikely hero, fun and heart. Ratatouille is right up there with the Walt Disney legacy films. Bravo.Ratatouille's story is a story of prejudice, triumph and cheer about a rat with a talent in his keen sense of smell and in gourmet cooking, and a big dream and he gets lucky, and even though you might have a few reservations about ""rats"" in a kitchen (I did!), that's what makes this film so wonderful - it'll bring your 'imagination' and 'fantasy' back - and not the reality of ""hey, there are disease ridden RATS in the kitchen!"" Disney Animation was always on the forefront of that. Remember those days...those carefree, childhood, imaginative days? No? Then go see this, you'll be happily reminded.Threre isn't enough praise to give to the animators at PIXAR here as well, the characters are well developed and drawn out and they have captured Paris wonderfully and puts you right there. You cheer and clap at this film but best of all, you laugh - with you and yours. This IS a family movie indeed that doesn't hit you over the head with that notion. And that's a good thing. Go see this....it's a lot of fun!","

"Ratatouille","paul2001sw-1","12 December 2007","Modern animated features have often been marked by profound ruminations of life and death 'Toy Story', 'Madagascar') or by hip references to popular culture (the 'Shrek' movies). But 'Ratatouille', this year's smash hit, it by contrast a very conventional animation, a straightforward cartoon story inspired by the simple pun that gives the film its name; indeed, it reminded me in some ways of 'Wallace and Grommit', although (obviously) without the northern English flavour. I liked the animation of France (Citroen D-Seies included) and Peter O' Toole is very funny, voicing a snooty restaurant critic, but I think a chance was missed to make the rats as physically repulsive as most people find them in real life; a cuddly rat is sort of missing the point. And overall, I found (as an adult viewer), the same joke stretched a little thin by the end of the film; a film where a woman shoots up her own house to kill a rat (as happens early in this movie) is not one to encourage dark thoughts about the nature of life.","

"Ratatouille","tollini","25 June 2007","I saw this film on June 15th, 2007 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival's Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture ""explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life."" Heartland gave that award to this film.Pixar has an incredible streak of commercial and artistic animation successes. This is their 8th in a row, and their riskiest. Toys and cars and bugs and fish and monsters and superheroes are easier to make endearing than a RAT. But, PIXAR pulls it off.This is a story of a French rat, Remy, who dreams to be more. Instead of eating garbage like his family and friends, he aspires to create great food like his hero Gusteau. Gusteau is a famous chef and cooking writer and television cooking star and restaurant owner. Gusteau's motto is ""Anyone Can Cook."" The bad news is Gusteau dies, but the good news is he comes back as a ghost or a figment of the rat's imagination to aid our rat in his dreams. The rat arrives at Gusteau's restaurant and uses the body of a lowly garbage boy to follow the rat's instructions and to create great food. The rat even moves in with the garbage boy.The animation is stunningly good. PIXAR has made the animation more detailed and more nuanced for every one of their succeeding films and this tradition continues. You learn about cooking and your mouth waters throughout the film. The Ratatouille, a French vegetable stew, can be tasted and smelled in the theater. By the way, the ""Rat"" in Ratatouille has nothing to do with a ""rat.""Remy is inspiring. Here is a character that will not settle on his expected life, but strives for greatness and to add to the world. And he will not give up or be discouraged. The ugly(?) rat becomes beautiful.FYI  There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video.","

I'm no CGI snob - the animation look great to me. The music was unobtrusive, noticeable only when it was supposed to be notice. Other pluses to me was an absence of song and dance scenes and cutesy sidekicks. The story (thankfully) took a couple of turns that bypassed the paths usually ambled upon in animated stories that have animals presenting human traits. And although it did have a happy ending, it didn't have the expected ""everyone's dreams came true and they all lived happily ever after"" ending, which was a nice change. What I liked most of all, was how the movie was able to express the concept that preparing food should be more than a necessary chore, that eating food is more than just fueling your body, that eating should be an enjoyable experience. I am now on a quest myself to find a recipe for ratatouille!!!","

If I had one complaint (and it's VERY small) it was a just a little too long, but not by much. But the voices, the computer animation, the music, and above all the story were all top notch. I'm continually amazed at how Pixar continues to crank out great films like these that both children and adults can appreciate. I have a feeling most critics and film goers alike will rate this one very high. I wholeheartedly recommend the film - it really was a fun night out at the movies! Congrats Pixar!!

"Ratatouille","jdkraus","28 July 2007","Since ""Finding Nemo"" and ""The Incredibles"", I haven't' seen a highly dynamic 3-D animated film. I entered the theater with an open-mind for ""Ratatouille"", and I have to say that this animated film has redeemed the name of animation.The quality of the animation was absolutely awe-inspiring! The details of the characters were very creative and authentic; the fur on the rats looked like fur rather than computer-animated figures and the humans were in a very retro-styled fashion, matching Brad Bird's past ""The Incredibles"". But the thing that fascinated me the most with the animation was how well the action sequences were choreographed and how amazing they were to watch, especially with the scooter chase with Skinner and the rat Remy.The voices were distinctive and talented; having no feel of a celebrity's voice being attached to them like Shrek. The story is on the childish side of the irony of a rat having a sudden, but beautiful passion of being cook of fine food, but like all other Pixar films, it has a good moral to it. The approximate time of the film maybe almost two hours, which is long for an animated film, but it, does not drag.But the thing that bothered me with this was that it had two unnecessary scenes of guns. Personally, for a G-rated film, that's a bit over the top. And there were also some minor scenes of unpleasant death threats that some of the character's made to each other, as well as some inappropriate innuendos. It should have gotten a PG rating in my mind.Otherwise, great fun and ""wow"" to Pixar animators. 9/10 -I'd be a little suggestive for your younger kids parents.","

"Ratatouille","tieman64","20 February 2008","Like ""The Incredibles"", Brad Bird's earlier film, ""Ratatouille"" celebrates the passionate, sometimes aggressive, pursuit of excellence. But while ""The Incredibles"" dealt with superheroes pushing aside mediocrity and embracing their powers, ""Ratatouille"" paints a lowly rat as a budding artist who must, in the quest for greatness, rise above those around him.The plot, a thinly disguised rift of Plato's ""Ion"" (in which Socrates and Ion discuss everything from art to art criticism), unfolds in an unpretentious but profound manner. Rats (ie humans) are dirty, uncivilised, pack animals. They eat garbage, live in filth and are generally stupid. But Remy is different. He dreams, he reads, he dares to experience different tastes. In short, he's an imaginative little rat and completely out of place amongst his barbaric brothers! And so Remy leaves his family behind and embarks on a quest to become an artist. But like all great men, Remy first needs a mentor. In this case, his mentor is a dead chef by the name of Gusteau. Gusteau is Remy's hero, his role model, and so Remy shall live his rodent life by Gusteau's ideals! Of course, being a rat, Remy can't accomplish anything on his own. To rectify this he enlists the help of Linguini, a bumbling kid who lacks ambition, drive and direction. By living in Linguini's hat and ""pulling his strings"" - like a film director takes control of his crew, or a puppeteer controls a puppet - Remy uses Linguini to create and make art, which the film equates with fine French cuisine.The film is so determined to examine art's function on the collective and the collective's role in the creation of art, that later in the film Remy's family comes to the rescue and likewise helps him create. Though they do not understand his artistic view the world, though they do not respond as he does to fine art and sophisticated food, they nevertheless love Remy enough to band together and help him create and fulfil his dreams.And so Bird stresses the communal aspect of creation. No artist, especially a filmmaker, no matter how independent he views himself to be, can accomplish greatness without help. And though a budding artist must (somewhat naively) break away from his family, at times ridiculing their lack of understanding, Remy can not realise his dreams without their love and support.It's interesting to note that Remy has no mother in the film. His family is all male. Historically, most mothers embrace their son's artistic desires. It's the practical father figure which the artist must overcome and prove himself to. What's sweet is that Remy shrugs his father aside, dares to be independent, but then needs his father to accomplish his dreams. Brad Bird, and many film-makers, likewise started off with sceptical family support and funding.Eventually Remy rallies a band of artists together (one character called Colette makes a point to label each of the chefs as artists and bandits). These are not cooks, they're rebels and outlaws! Of course none of these artists want to dream or take risks. Like Remy's dad, they've become stagnated. They follow Gusteaus recipes by the letter, not daring to step out of the box and create for themselves. But Remy is different. He has a vision! He has that creative spark! ""Change is nature, Dad,"" Remy says to his father, ""we can influence when we decide to!"" But Remy's father doesn't understand. He thinks his son is a wide-eyed dreamer. But when Dad sees little Remy commanding a kitchen full of humans like a maverick film-director, a smile creeps across his face. He understands his son, sees the strength in him, and promptly rallies behind the kid.The film's message is summed up best during a final-act monologue. Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere. To be a great artist, one must be willing to fight for change. And so Remy lifted Linguini and his tribe of rats out of the gutter. He believed in himself and they believed in him, and together they all prospered.Ultimately, ""Rattatouille"" is one of PIXAR's most mature films, thanks largely to Brad Bird's simple yet sophisticated scriptwriting. The film advocates creative independence, yet stresses the importance of community. It celebrates the artist, but destroys the artist's condescending and pretentious view of ""non artists"" as ""simpletons"". It praises high art and refined tastes, but sings hymns of praise to the simple pleasures of the common man.Furthermore, the film examines the role of the artist and the importance of those who support, finance, inspire, and critique him. It touches upon the artist's ability to inspire the heard through his own actions and how the power of the one and the needs the many inter-mesh. The film has several cute relationships, but director Brad Bird is smart enough to recognise their darker underpinnings. There are symbiotic relationships here every bit as dark as Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"".Finally, the film ends with a beautiful monologue by an egotistical art critic and is packed with both gorgeous virtual camera work, and romantic architecture, the Parisian landscape rendered in loving detail. As CGI allows animators to play with space, refine their shots and fine tune their virtual landscapes, there are scenes here which push camera work and composition to perfection. Here, every shot is perfect. Every camera move, intricate and precise. The long tracking shot which follows Remy as he navigates the catacombs of Paris is particularly beautiful.10/10 – A smart film and a beautiful love letter to artists. Visually, the film is also divine. Pixar created realistic CGI plastic with ""Toy Story"", hair and wind effects with ""Monsters Inc"", water effects with ""Nemo"", metal and reflections with ""Cars"" and now here, with ""Ratatouille"", they tackle food and architecture. What next will they try? Air and vacuum?Worth multiple viewings.","

"Ratatouille","baileycrawly","28 November 2020","Ratatouille isn't as good as some of the other Pixar entries, in my personal opinion, but it's still a pretty good movie. It's perhaps a little bit too long and tries to do a little bit too much. As far as emotions are concerned, this film doesn't really do a whole lot in that area, which is a real shame because one of PIxar's most potent weapons was the ability to make an audience feel strong emotions and react emotionally to the things transpiring on screen. This movie was absolutely brilliant from an animation point of view and really continues the upwards trajectory of raising the bar not just for their own productions, but also for the future of animated film in general.
It just felt a little overdone in some places and undercooked (if I may say that) in others. It didn't connect with me in quite the same way that other Pixar films did. Not to say it's a bad movie, because it was an enjoyable experience for me... it just didn't offer as much resonance as their other entries.","

After a slight let down in 2006 with a story about race cars,(although beautifully animated (as always)) - a poor subject matter choice for a good story, Pixar are back on track with this stunning animation. I didn't think the captivating storytelling that was Toy Story could be topped; but it has been done with this, the chef-d'oeuvre from Brad Bird. The initial concept alone of a rat wanting to work in a restaurant as a cook is pure gold, and it only gets better. The Parisian world's artistic detail, subtle references, expert animation, charming characters, and wonderful story make this a definite must see for everyone.Praise the almighty Pixar!","

"Ratatouille","harry_tk_yung","2 August 2007","Before I saw this movie, I kept telling myself there must be a reason why an animation feature can attain such a high ranking in IMDb (has actually dropped slightly since then, to #65 and 8.5/10). Having now seen it, I do see why, although I still don't see any sense of ranking animation together with ""real"" movies that have human actors. But I would certainly give this movie a #1 among all the animations I've seen.First off, Pixar is indeed impressive as ever. With the depth and light-and-shade, some scenes look more real than real scenes shot with a camera. Facial expressions are also just as good as real. And there are so much admirable details in each frame that you'll miss more than you can take in.Behind the astounding visual are characters and stories rich in creative imagination. It is a cartoon and the movie never pretends to be otherwise. But it's impossible not to marvel at the ingenious plot -the ghost of a top chef, or just a fragment of the hero's imagination, helps that hero, a rat, to become a top chef by working, in turn, through a young floor-sweeper who does the actual cooking. How? Through hiding in the young man's chef's hat and pulling his hair as one manipulates the strings of a marionette. Now, why didn't I think of that! And then, there are many layers in the plot, not contrived or pretentious, but just offered to you naturally as part of the story: family value, office politics, aspiration vs reality, peaceful co-existences between races (in this case, humans and rats). There are of course poignancy and uplifting moments, which are, however, never over done. This is a sensible movie that entertains you hugely, moves you gently, and makes you think a little as you go along.I am not an animation person but this one gets my vote","

Only the mouse was likable enough for me.

Remy (Patton Oswalt) is a rat with impeccable tastes. He is also dismissed by his patriarchal father until he is discovered to be able to taste for poison. He becomes the clan's poison detector. He is still unhappy with eating garbage. After stealing the Gusteau cookbook, he gets separated from the family and arrives at late Gusteau's failing restaurant in Paris. Linguini is the new garbage boy. Linguini ruins the soup and Remy fixes it to new heights for a critic. Linguini is given the credit. With Remy's help, the garbage boy becomes one of the best chef in the kitchen. Skinner was Gusteau's sous chef and is the beneficiary in his will except Linguini may be Gusteau's love child.Brad Bird and company have cooked up a nice stew of traditional animated fare. Remy is an appealing protagonist. The message is good. The animation is impeccable. Pixar delivers something very traditional from a less than traditional source. The only change I would do is have Remy wash his hands more. There is an aversion to rats when dealing with food. The movie needs to alleviate some of that hesitation. After all, Remy goes everywhere including the sewer.","

Now, that is quite an accomplishment.Visually, this is one of my very favorite Pixar movies. The character designs are very appealing to me, and the technical detail is outstanding. The look of the characters themselves are only outshone by the marvelous Parisian backdrops that we get glimpses of through windows and from sky shots. The music is great, the message is good, and the story is entertaining for kids and adults. I put Ratatouille on that second Pixar tier.

"Ratatouille","bob the moo","5 May 2008","Evicted from his home and separated from his family, rat Remy is living the dream as an unwelcome guest in the kitchen of the famous Gusteau Restaurant in Paris. His passion and gift is cookery and a series of events sees him with soup that had been messed by garbage boy Linguini. Chef Skinner is ready to fire Linguini for his meddling until the customers love ""his"" improvised soup. Skinner keeps him on but Linguini knows the truth, striking a deal with Remy where the latter provides the cookery and the former provides the ""looking like a human"" bit.Although it won the Oscar for best film, Ratatouille got mixed reviews from critics on release. Watching it for myself I must admit that it exposes the long-term value of the ""best animated feature"" aware because it is not a film that should show up as ""best"" unless it is in a very short list (which of course it was). This is not to say that the film is no good though and indeed it is a perfectly good story told in a very slick, amusing and engaging way with all the usual quality one would expect from Pixar in regards animation. The story has the usual moral about the importance of the heart over appearance and in this regard it works really well, with a touching character at the core. I refer of course to Remy, because Linguini is all a bit wet as a character.This doesn't matter too much because Linguini is rarely the sole focus in the way that Remy is. The story develops well across the running time and I was never bored once but, and here's the thing, I didn't laugh that often. For me the story was strong enough so that the lack of really good consistent laughs didn't bother me but I can understand why it is an issue for others. In many ways it is because Pixar are victims of their own success and we now expect the strong heartfelt story to be underlain by constant quick fire gags and one-liners. The lack of the latter is not a weakness in the film but it does slightly disappoint until you get into the story.It is not without laughs though but they are more general and less smart than you might expect. The big colourful action is amusing and entertaining and it all drives the good story forward effectively. The voice cast for once is not filled with famous A-list names but you don't feel their absence. Oswalt is the best main character and is better served than Romano with material. Holm is nearly unrecognisable but good, although I'm not so sure about Garofalo's mixed attempt at accent. Dennehy and Sohn are fun in support while O'Toole is a real good piece of casting.Overall this is a really good film that delivers a consistently engaging story with heart and humour. It is not the usual quick-fire one-liner stuff one might expect but it is still an very enjoyable film that both parents and children will enjoy.","

The animation (again, good) is no better than anything else they have released.Even the message is the same old story: someone (or thing) from one group wants to be in another. His current group says no, the new one is hesitant, but he has to be himself. Now, that is a good message, and this may be an extreme example (rats in a kitchen a la ""Muppets Take Manhattan"") but it is still nothing new.","

"Ratatouille","FiendishDramaturgy","27 September 2007","This is not a home run in the Pixar/Disney Hall of Fame, but it IS enjoyable.RATATOULLE lacks soul, heart, and frivolities, which normally draw children and adults alike by the droves. This film is a romantic sort, as are most Disney animated features, with the Comedy factor omitted from the formula this time, and the movie suffers for it.It was only moderately interesting and somehow managed to be quaint without endearing itself to its target audience. Some adults will particularly like this due to the adult themes and elements, but the age group who are out there attempting to make it on their own like the lead character in this work, will not be attracted to this venue.This sad fact is negated; however, by the fact that this film did only marginally less at the box office, than the widely loved (and vastly superior) Cars. It is further negated by the fact that RATATOULLE receives a user rating here at IMDb.com, which surpasses Cars by laps. Deservedly so, in my opinion. RATATOULLE is a wonderful film, but it lacked the magic of the rest of its line.All in all? I sincerely hope this does not turn out to be the beginning of a trend into decline.

"Ratatouille","joestank15","2 July 2007","Ratatouille - A young adorable looking rat Remy (Patton Oswalt) has dreams of being a chef in Paris and teams up Cyrano-style with a sheepish no-talent named Linguini (Lou Romano) to cook and restore glory to a formerly 5-star restaurant (booted down to 3. Ouch.) Animated films are getting hard to judge and harder to sit through these days. As the quality of animation gets higher, the pool of ideas gets lower. it seems we have more and more talking penguins, fish, and Shrek rip-offs (Heck, from what I've heard, Shrek3 was a Shrek rip-off). Ratatouille succeeds in bringing something new to the table. Brad Bird directs, so like The Incredibles, this one is more for the adults than the kids (Suprising as it is G rated) but that shouldn't be a bad thing. It's still talking rats and there are many well constructed prat-falls to hold their interest.The movie was not as funny as I had hoped, though it still is genuinely funny at times, but what held me was how much the film sucked me in and had me really caring about the characters. I barely worried about the logistics of a rat being able to read and cook and control Linguini from under his chef's hat. The graphics, when I noticed, were breathtaking. The food and the ""tasting"" animation looks wonderful.There is a great voice cast as well. Remy is well animated and I just love that little guy. Patton Oswalt did a great job. Lou Romano managed to convey awkward yet well-meaning in a way that borrowed a little from Jon Heder. He has some great scenes with Janeane Garofolo who plays hard-edged Collete. Peter O' Toole has a wonderful bit as the creepy critic (animation style straight out of Tim Burton) Anton Ego.I was happy that there weren't that many digs at the French. There still are, and I'm a touch disappointed that both the leads speak in completely neutral American accents, but test audiences have to be pleased I'm sure. Ian Holm is nearly undetectable as the villainous super-stereotypical French head chef Skinner.I like that Remy the Rat can't talk to any of the humans including Linguini, something that always bugged me in most of the other animated movies involving animals or people talking in different languages (most irritatingly Pocahontas). It's of little consequence to the review but it's a little personal preference note. Ebert includes those so why can't I? The film meanders a little between the second and third acts but the conclusion is adorable and hilarious. I love the little touches to the animation and the story. This film was clearly a labor of love, not profit, though it'll acquire a lot of both to be sure. An A-","

"Ratatouille","JohnDeSando","4 July 2007","Food, family, creativity, criticism, racism, romance: If these themes satisfy your critical standards for a superior film, then Ratatouille should qualify as one of your favorite films of the year.Pixar and director Brad Bird, who defined family entertainment with The Incredibles, have another human comedy animation hit on their hands, and the foodies have to love it. Remy (voice of Patton Oswalt), a rat in a French restaurant, helps a hapless lad named Linguini become the five-star restaurant's star chef.The rat is a rodent realistically realized, homely by contrast with those more pleasant looking in Flushed Away. The human faces of the non-rats are by far the best renditions of reality I have seen in hyper-humanized computer graphics. The restaurant kitchen is so real I wanted to cut onions and crush garlic. But the piece de resistance is Anton Ego, the food critic, as trenchant a criticism of us self-centered, aloof critics as will ever appear on screen.The voice of Peter O'Toole makes his demeanor even more insipid and scary, his words heavy with moralizing: ""In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face is that, in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defense of the new."" I was humbled and exalted at the same time. Art for art's sake, I say.Bertolt Brecht said, ""Food first, then morality."" Well, throw out the moralizing platitudes and eat. Food is the music of Ratatouille, nourishment for all the adults of the family and a primer on kitchens for kids who think good food comes out of a window and through the car window.","

It was a relief to see Ratatouille is really, truly excellent. The reason I did not give it 10/10 is simple: maybe some of the dialogues should have been trimmed a bit; sometimes the talking parts seemed to be a bit slower and longer than they should have been. And that's all what I can say on the negative side. Ratatouille is great. It is heartfelt, it is moving, it has style, great French feeling, it has lovable characters (especially Remy, of course), great story and, again, except from some man-to-man dialogues, every second of the movie shows creativity, care and a really high skill that the team at Pixar has. I loved the talking scenes with Remy as his gestures are great, also seeing his little heart pumping all the time etc. makes him instantly lovable. And the non-talking scenes (call them 'action scenes', not as if it was an action movie) are always so skillfully directed and effective that I was totally amazed. I haven't enjoyed an animated movie like this for years; I think it is among the three best Pixar movies (the other two being Finding Nemo and The Incredibles). I just can't express how much I loved it. Pixar is really the heir to (Walt) Disney as Remy is for Gusto - as both really do know how to serve food that is perfect even for the most hateful critic...","

"Ratatouille","MacAindrais","3 July 2007","Ratatouille (2007) ****I'm not sure why, but I just can't allow myself to give Ratatouille anything less than full marks. As far as creativity in roles goes, its pretty standard dealing with humans (nothing new to animation there) and talking rats (linguistic rodents, been there done that). There are no talking cars or monsters or fish or super heroes. Ratatouille is an example of a classic storyline overhauled and directed at adults and children all the like. This IS a movie for everyone, young and old, rich or poor. To top it off, its without a doubt the most brilliantly piece of animated work I have ever seen. The movie is at once elitist and proletarian. It takes the lowest of all creatures, rats, and uses them to defend intelligence and quality and at the same time ridicules snobbery. It makes the rats cute, but at the same time still unsettling, especially when seen in packs. The film opens in the French country side, with a rat named Remy, our hero, jumping out of a window and then a freeze frame of him with glass smashing around him in mid air. Sound familiar movie buffs? It should. A direct homage to The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. This is just the first of many salutes to other films right up to Usual Suspects.Remy gets separated from his clan and ends up in ol' Paris, which is stunningly animated right from the Eiffel Tower to the rotary and the cobble stones. To make a long review shorter, he meets up with the imagined ghost of the great Gusteau, who's motto 'everyone can cook' inspires the young rat. He is lead to Gusteau's restaurant, which has faded since his death, and is now run by a short temperamentally authoritarian chef. Remy manages to befriend a new kitchen worker named Linguini, who may or may not be Gusteau's son, who cannot cook unless Remy hides under his hat and uses some very interesting puppetry. Ratatouille takes classic character types and strips them down and removes the clichés and manages to deliver the unexpected. The film also takes those characters, their surroundings and the food they use to create their meals and animates then in absolutely stunning fashion. Every little detail is noted, from the look of a wet rats fur right down to the beats of water on fresh vegetables. The animation is nothing short of incredible.Yes, Ratatouille uses big words that kids won't get - they will however get the point - and that is because this film is first and foremost, I think, for adults. The kid factor is just a side pot. The films defining monologue comes from a critic, who acknowledges the ultimate insignificance of a critics work, yet retorts that their work is made worth while by being able to influence people to try something, if even only a few. It also acknowledges that though not everyone can be great, greatness truly can come from anywhere. This monologue is perhaps the best ever given in an animated film. Like the rest of the movie, it delivers its point in eloquent fashion, but does it easily enough that a child can understand what its getting at. The movie is not overly hilarious . Its not always going for those big laughs. It finds joy in going for big payoffs in quality. Its a great story, and it never forces itself to be funny. That said, don't think that this movie isn't a laugher, there are lots of good little jokes that will have you smiling. And after all, its often more pleasant to just sit there smiling from ear to ear often than busting a gut occasionally.And that is what makes Ratatouille so great. It truly is a film that manages to be ageless; defend quality through the lowest ranks while damning elitist snobs. The critic's monologue was right: We can't all be great, but greatness can come from anywhere. And Bird and his team at Pixar chose the least likely of creatures to carry out that message, and I'll tell you, those rats get the job done.4/4","

This one doesn't last as long as their golden age (thanks to Cars 2, in 2011), but the four films they released from 2007 to 2010 are among some of the best animated movies of all time, period.What more can be said about Ratatouille specially? It's fantastic. The animation still looks great, the setting is wonderful, the music is great, the characters are fun, the pacing is excellent, it takes what sounds (on paper) like a silly premise and really makes it work, and while it's not quite a Pixar tearjerker, it has a good heart and some moments that are quietly moving in their own way.It really is fantastic, and worthy of all the praise it gets, and of the Pixar movies I've rewatched so far this year, I'd say I only like Toy Story 2 and Finding Nemo more than this (both by a hair, really).","

However, as of today, the real treat is in the script, the rich colors and detailed features of the movie, the consistent, compelling action in the movie. While not rising to The Incredibles in terms of deeper substantive, emotional concerns, this feature film provides a tastefully rich satisfaction with its focus on the main characters allowing us to intimately connect with them without any distractions. Eight out of Ten Stars.","

"Ratatouille","cocosamar","24 July 2021","One of the most touching movie of Disney. When Igo tasted the ratatouille and he remembered his moms food, it touched my heart. Sometimes in life we remember the sound, smell or taste of a memory. It remained me that sometimes you wish you could go back.","

"Ratatouille","fernandoschiavi","4 June 2021","""In a way, the job of a critic is easy. We take little risk and take pleasure in evaluating those who have submitted their work and reputation to us. We gain fame from negative reviews that are fun to write and read. But the stark reality we critics must face is that, on the whole, the simplest crap is perhaps more significant than our biggest criticism. But there are times when a critic actually risks something, such as when he suddenly discovers something new. The world is often hostile to new talent and new creations. The new needs to be encouraged.""Brad Bird is one of the best animation directors in Hollywood. Earlier in his career, he even directed a few episodes of The Simpsons between 1990 and 1991, and with The Iron Giant in 1999 which he directed for Warner, he got good reception in his feature film debut. His next work was his debut on Pixar with the excellent The Incredibles (2004), a film in which he debuted with 3D technology at Pixar Studios and which told the story of a family of superheroes, and which won him his first Oscar for Best Animated Film, with the film still taking home the award for best sound mixing. The film also won several awards, including best director, at the Annie Awards, the Oscar for animation.Ratatouillé is Pixar's newest bet in partnership with Disney and only proves the already recognized quality of the company's productions and the talent of Brad Bird. The script knew how to work a simple story, full of punctual messages that fully reach its target audience: the family, without any restrictions.We observe the wise mix of funny scenes, with more emotional and romantic scenes in an organic way. Through a complex and well-knit script, topics such as family and personal interests, the importance of following a dream and being persistent, of honesty are addressed. Ratatouille is an inexhaustible source of teaching for all ages. The characters are very captivating (from the good guys to the bad guys) and the unfolding of the story fulfills all expectations generated from the first scene. Let's take for example Remy's construction, voiced by Patton Oswalt. First we have to highlight the daring of putting a mouse cooking, something that doesn't go together at all. Just imagining your food being prepared by a rat (no matter how hard it washes its hands) is going against everything we believe in hygiene when we eat out. Remy admires humans for their creativity and the possibilities they have to invent new things and appreciate what's really good, and dreams of somehow taking part in that world through their talent, even though it's seen as a pest. But by no means does Remy abandon the characteristics of a mouse, which is what he is. He loves his family of rats, but he can't stand being torn between his family and his great passion, cooking. Remy doesn't believe in humans as the greatest threat as his father does. At one point he says, ""Change is nature, Dad. The part we can influence. And it starts when we decide..."". Remy was walking away from his father and he asked him where he would go, and Remy replied: ""With luck... I'll go ahead"". Remy becomes one of the friendliest characters of any animation ever produced.Another representation is related to the figure of the critic, here it is gastronomy, but it can be applied to a critic of any profession. Anton Ego, brilliantly voiced by the legend Peter O'Toole, is one of the best characters. Presented at first sight as a usual caricature and can even be considered a villain, being shown living in a huge mansion, sporting a huge picture of himself on the wall that denotes his self-confidence and arrogance. As the film progresses, Anton becomes more human (including a flashback scene from his childhood in his humble home and eating delicious homemade food made by his mother), culminating at the point where Anton arrives and re-evaluates his own life, in one of the best final monologues of a movie ever seen.The other villain in the movie is Skinner (Ian Holm). Since Gusteau's death, he became the restaurant's Chef, and interested in inheriting the place, he tries to get rid of Linguini and find out how he learned to cook so well, but he can't due to the success of the soup made by the boy commanded by the skillful hands of Remy. Although a little caricatured, the character takes part in interesting scenes, such as Remy's pursuit through the streets of Paris, or the one in which he tries to get Linguini drunk to extract information from the boy, or even when he is attacked by rats in the final stretch. He is a really insufferable villain and does well the task of causing anger to those who watch.It's impossible not to talk about the phenomenal quality of the animation, especially with elements so difficult to reproduce in 3D such as fur, smoke, water, and environmental changes in elements such as wind, rain, food texture, among others. Besides, of course, the facial expressions of both rats and human characters. It is worth highlighting the movement of kitchen chefs in the handling of food and in the preparation of dishes. It's mouth-watering to see all those soups, breads, cheeses, meats and, of course, the Ratatouille in the title. Still, it's remarkable how, even in a light story, the seriousness is constantly brought organically back into the plot - as in the beautiful and haunting scene where Remy's father shows him what happens to the rats that get too close to humans. The production design of Harley Jessup, winner of the Annie Awards for the work, faithfully reproduces every detail of a typical French restaurant kitchen, as well as the other environments of the restaurant. But despite most of the scenes taking place in the restaurant, several scenes reproducing Paris attest to the perfectionism of every detail of what we see on screen. We came across historical monuments, details of sidewalks and streets, reproduction of cars, streets, building facades and a panoramic view of the entire city. The indoor and outdoor shots are lovely.The movement of the characters is very detailed and realistic, making everything much more believable. The relationship between humans and animals was treated in a unique way, not forcing dialogues between animals and humans, yet creating a mutual understanding in a unique and universal language. Note that although Linguini and the other humans understood what the rat wanted and vice versa, the rats only ""talked"" to each other, because when they are seen by humans, only animal noises and not words are heard.We must also mention the wonderful soundtrack by Michael Giacchino that passes all the magical atmosphere of Paris and still entertains us at all times. The Oscar-nominated soundtrack grows in moments of chase and action, uses specific instruments in the romantic themes of Linguini and Colette, and entertains in scenes where Linguini is controlled like a puppet by Remy. The lighting and textures are also notorious. The fur of rats, the night lighting of the streets of Paris and the dimness of the sewers, in addition to the sunny and romantic city at other times. Highlight for the scene in which Remy walks through the Parisian underground, until reaching the top of a building where he saw the sign and realizes he is in his idol's restaurant.This new Pixar production alongside Disney Studios is less crowded than previous in-house movies, especially when we compare this one to Brad Bird's previous work The Incredibles. On the other hand, it is better worked on its text, and it still shows agility and good humor. We even overlooked details of how Remy manipulates Linguini hidden in his hat. As strong as Remy had, the moves were always forced, always with the intention of causing laughter in the audience. Brad Bird never gives up fun like any other animation and teaches many essential lessons especially to children.A simple, sensitive, exciting original film, especially in its last half hour, with an unquestionable quality. A film that gives us valuable lessons of friendship and love, of believing in your dreams, however impossible they may seem, that even the humblest can reach great positions if there is willpower, persistence and above all talent for the that it proposes to carry out, and to believe that friendships can come from those we least expect, and the importance of recognizing talent and knowing how important everyone is for the team's success. We can still cite the ending that found a happy, but more realistic and satisfying solution. A must for any age and at any time. Another hit by Disney / Pixar and absolutely deserving of winning the Oscar for Best Animation. It really is a masterpiece of the genre! Before the film, there is a traditional presentation of a short film by the company. This time it's the funny Almost Abducted, directed by Oscar-nominated Gary Rydstrom.""They managed to shake my frame. In the past, I made no secret of my disdain for Chef Gasteau's famous motto: 'Anyone can cook.' But I realize that I'm only now fully understanding what he meant. Become great artists. But a great artist can come from anywhere.""","

"Ratatouille","ElijahCSkuggs","29 June 2007","Being a gigantic fan of Vermin and Gourmet Cooking I just had to see this. Pixar is back with another fantastic, funny, warm-hearted adventure that is really going to stand the test of time. So far the reviews for Ratatouille are unbelievable and I don't think they'll ever let up. And ya know what, this movie deserves all the praise it's gonna get.Ratatouille is the story about a little rat named Remy. Remy is basically your regular looking rat. Though Remy is a little different. What separates him from his fellow rats is that he's got a special talent. Remy's little schnoz is incredibly fine-tuned. He can smell this from that with no problem whatsoever. Well, this amazing smelling ability gives him fantastic ideas when it comes to food, and eventually cooking. What follows is a timeless tale where Remy and his pal Linguini take to the kitchen to resurrect a once world re-known french restaurant. Will they satisfy the food critics? Or will they get fried?Ratatouille is a perfect movie-going experience. I really can't find anything wrong with it. Entertaining situations led by unique characters with amazing voice work. Every environment be it the Paris backdrop, an Old Lady's backyard or even an awkward chef's pad is absolutely stunning. Ratatouille isn't just for the wee ones either. Pretty much all the jokes are adult-level humor. Obviously you got the slips and falls and one-joke characters that the kids will love, but so will the grown-ups. The writing is top notch stuff, some of the best writing around without a doubt. I can't recommend this flick enough. Bring the entire family and have a great time.","

"Ratatouille","agmoldham","24 October 2007","I suppose any Pixar film has the unenviable task of living up to the previous movies from the production company. The Toy Story movies are the gold standard and equally fantastic for both children and adults.Ratatouille follows the adventures of a rat who befriends a cleaner at a restaurant which has seen happier times. The rat is a frustrated cook and it gets the chance to prove its skill via the cleaner. The film is a little long and drags a bit at times - That's the adult perspective and I suspect some children would also be restless at times. As ever with Pixar some of the visual are stunning especially the cityscapes of Paris. Not in the same league as Toy Story, but still fairly entertaining.","

"Ratatouille","eschetic","7 July 2007","RATATOUILLE, the latest deservedly successful Pixar entry in the animation sweepstakes is effortlessly the best summer movie for families who want an outing that won't insult the kids and won't go over the heads of the adults. It really does have all the elements for cross-over cartoon success: cute fuzzy characters, front loaded (but ""comic"" - no gore and no one dies despite many shotgun blasts and talk of poison) violence, physical discomfort (as the ""little chef"" and his human counterpart work out their communication system), sexless romance (the human and the girlfriend he's desperate to impress) and a comic villain who the fuzzy character can defeat repeatedly in beautifully plotted farce choreography.The capper, of course, is that the film also wants to be an allegory on people being judged on their ABILITIES rather than their appearances, being *honest* about those abilities (the fuzzy little guy is a great natural and self-trained cook, the human is neither) and the importance of TEAMWORK (the real trouble comes when egos get in the way). So far so good.Unfortunately, it also has a massive caveat to the allegory and the enjoyment (knocking two points off the rating for me): rats in the kitchen. Well, um, yes, that will give some people pause if they actually think about what they are seeing (adults are inclined to do that). Rats are legally verboten in most places of food preparation - and it has nothing to do with anything that is their fault. They ARE cute and fuzzy, but they also may carry ticks and fleas which frequently carry disease. Living in less than cleanly places, they walk through places and things with high bacterial counts. Unhealthy.The film is brave enough to realize they have to address this little problem - the baggage more sophisticated viewers who are flocking to Pixar's best work WILL being in with them - and so the film backs their comic villain (his initial defeat over ""the will"" is far to quick and ""tossed off"" to be as satisfying as it should be) with a restaurant health inspector who is comically dealt with temporarily, but since the authors couldn't actually kill him off or believably convert him, they were stuck for a predictably happy ending.In a plot twist which young audiences will have to really scramble to follow (actually they may not care, but their parents who will have to explain it to them if they do will need to pay attention) they settle for a wise, if slightly melancholy one.Does it matter? Not as much as you might think, but it does keep what comes very close to being a classic from true greatness and leaves the rightly enthusiastic audiences with just a very, very good film. Don't miss it - there is so much clever execution to revel in - but be prepared NOT to check your mind at the door. This is a film which might be more fun if you could, but will leave you with much more to think about when you don't, even if it undercuts the allegory and some of the fun. That in itself can be very satisfying.","

"Ratatouille","cutmaclass","29 June 2007","Generally, Pixar has shied away from the realm of humanity in previous films, but Ratatouille finally marks their entry into human relationships and instead of focusing on the fantasy world of little critters, they provide a remarkably balanced picture of both (completely lovable) character ensembles. This is the essence of movie-making, people. The comedy hearkens back to ye olde days; this movie could have worked just as well as a silent film. Camera angles (if you'd like to call them that) are top-notch and provide an invigoration to the action that never gets old. The acting and writing are very smart; this isn't just a kiddy film. There are strong plot ties to egoism, relationships, and a rather Burton-esquire approach to critical cynicism, not to mention references to religion (*gasp*), alcohol (*gasp*), and illegitimate children (*gasp*) which are unfairly taboo in today's family films. My true thanks go out Pixar for making what is perhaps the best animated film in a very long time, one that can easily contend with Disney classics, and my new personal favorite animated feature.","

"Ratatouille","Mrswing","10 August 2007","I went into Ratatouille with huge expectations due to the glowing reviews. I generally love Pixar features.To my surprise, I wasn't immediately swept off my feet as the movie started. I waited, and waited... and though there were some brilliant sequences, there were just too many elements which did not ring true for me to get into the film.Things I had problems with: 1) Remy isn't really a rat, he's a human in rat shape. He already knows how to cook, he can read, he's hygienic, he has moral qualms about 'stealing'... His only problem is that he's a rat, and thus unable to achieve his desires. That's a purely physical limitation, not a psychological one. So there's no real growth on his part, just the search for the opportunity to live his dream.2) Linguini is so passive and incompetent, he's really an uninteresting character. The conflict between him and Remy is forced - even when he's taking credit for Remy's talent (very late in the story), he does so because of circumstance and Remy has never before given any indication he's not okay with this.3) Colette is completely superfluous to the story. Moreover, she starts off extremely feminist and violently tough, but soon after becomes just another lovelorn female pining for idiotic Linguini. Her anger at the female-unfriendliness of the haute cuisine world is immediately forgotten. 4) Skinner is a badly realized character. He's only interested in his line of Gusteau frozen foods, yet he keeps the restaurant open and expects it to produce quality food. However, he doesn't try to improve the star rating (which could only help his business plans). On the other hand, he doesn't deliberately cut corners or lower standards to save money. (It's not clear to me whether his frozen foods have already been launched or whether this is a secret plan of his - if so, it's never discovered (as a revelation) by anyone during the film, so it doesn't really add to the storyline. Also, Skinner is so very concerned about Linguini being Gustave's son, feeling certain that he 'knows' something and his appearance just before the deadline is no accident. However, nothing is ever discovered about Skinner, he doesn't appear to have any dark secrets. So why the paranoid worrying? Finally, Skinner isn't really a successful villain to oppose Remy, as their goals never really clash. When Skinner finally captures Remy, it's not to kill him but to force him to cook more deep-frozen meals... Not exactly a fate worse than death. I was also irritated by his English name being coupled to a French(ish) accent.4) Anton Ego is an even less suitable opponent for Remy. He's a very mean character (almost vampire-like in looks), and directly responsible for Gusteau's death. Yet there is no punishment (though he indirectly killed Linguini's dad!), only a sense of immediate and total redemption. Why did he become such a monster (compared to the sweet and innocent boy he used to be)? If you think about it, the character is all about exercising tyrannical power (destroying the reputation of chefs for the fun of it), not the love of food as he claims. How does this put him into direct conflict with Remy? He's the main threat of the film but only shows up in the third act (when the less imposing Skinner has been largely disposed of). (It would also have been nice if Remy's food had first provoked culinary hallucinations of an incredible potency before flashing him back to his childhood) 5) Remy learns to control Linguini perfectly, but when they have to cook the sweetbreads, Linguini is once again careening off the walls etc. like in the much earlier apartment scenes.6) The kitchen personnel is very dull: nothing is done with them, and they have almost no personality (despite being introduced in a way which makes you expect them to have a far greater impact on the movie). Perhaps the whole rat family theme should have been dropped and more time should have been spent with the kitchen staff)7) major coincidences propel the story forwards: Remy losing his family and (especially) finding them again is really arbitrary.8) The final fate of Gusteau's restaurant is disappointing.9) Remy's unwillingness to believe humans hate rats when his father shows him the shop is really strange, as he's experienced the homicidal old lady. It would have been better if he remained convinced that Linguini is his friend and would never harm him no matter what, unlike other humans.10) The film lacks a climax as spectacular and inventive as Monsters Inc., Nemo and Incredibles.11) The paternity angle is resolved extremely quickly, after having received quite a build-up. The resolution was very unsatisfactory (more could have been done with it story-wise, and during development it probably was at one time or another).Finally, the film isn't that funny, compared to the other Pixar classics. Heck, Flushed Away (which had a less likable hero by far, and was less emotionally involving) is funnier by far than Ratatouille. Ratatouille is more serious in tone than many other Pixar films, but for me, the story told didn't convince and the moral lessons were far too heavy-handed (follow your dream, prejudice is bad, family comes first, critics are generally bad :-)...) The set pieces are very impressive, technically the film obviously breaks new barriers, and there are some nice jokes and little touches scattered over the film - but to me, the magic was missing. If I were to hazard a guess, I would say the development process of the story must have been extremely complicated and I often had the feeling that bits were left in that probably worked better in previous versions of the story, or alternately were added later without fitting the overall story perfectly.","

"Ratatouille","Movie-ManDan","18 September 2018","The critically acclaimed Disney animated film by Brad Bird has more humanity and originality than most films of the 2000s. It may be led by a rat and hundreds of other rats in his colony, but do not let that fool you into thinking this is a silly movie for boys who like gross things. If you are unappreciative of this, then you do not know much about the art of cinema.Patton Oswalt is pretty funny in general. He provides the voice of the star of this picture: a rat named Remy. His family lives in the country where he peaks into a house and gets inspired by the world's greatest chef, Auguste Gusteau (voiced by Brad Garrett) to become a chef himself. Remy's perseverance causes him to become an expert on making excellent food. But he's a three-inch rat. What could he do? This sounds like a very unoriginal underdog story. Just stay tuned for the story to unfold.The owner of the house blasts the rats which causes Remy to get separated from his family and wind up across from Gusteau's restaurant. Remy was in Paris the whole time but never even knew it. Now that he is in the city, he can be close to he idol's work. Gusteau recently passed away and mean food critic Anton Ego (one of Peter O'Toole's last performances) has made the restaurant lose its prestige. Gusteau has been appearing to Remy as his conscious and motivator.Imagine the most elegant and fancy restaurant you can. An appetizer the size of your fist costing over $100. That is this restaurant. Sure there are other animated films better looking than this, but the overall value of the look should not be overlooked. Once we see it, we fall in love and want to go there ourselves.Meanwhile, a useless janitor at the joint and total geek named Linguini (like the food) sees Remy and a bond between the two is formed. Although they speak different languages, Remy gets on Linguini and pulls on his hair which causes his body parts to move as a reflex. Linguini is now Remy's puppet. Back at the restaurant, Remy hides in Linguini's hat, puppeteers around and great dishes come about. Linguini doesn't know what he's doing, it is all in the rat. Head chef Skinner (Ian Holm) is really mean and tries to find the secret behind this wimp's success.'Ratatouille' is a relatable story about passion. We feel Remy's love for cooking as much as he does. In fact, the entire food aspect of this is rubbed off onto us. In the duration of the film, we feel like cooking is the best job in the world. Job well done.It is also one of the very few animated movies where the peril and action is limited. The biggest scene of danger is near the beginning when the old lady empties her shotgun on Remy's clan. The biggest obstacle is understanding. Who is going to believe that Linguini is being controlled by a rat? How will Ego find the food that Remy creates? These gentle and modest things are handled with such care and precision so that it stands out among other recent Pixar films.And, of course, the animation is excellent. The real looking rats and fancy setting do not clash. It is simply perfect.One thing that gets overlooked is the music by Michael Giacchino. He is one of the best music guys working in film today and he has made his best soundtrack in this film.'Ratatouille' is a delicate, delectable piece of cinema to forever be cherished.4/4","

"Ratatouille","come2whereimfrom","27 September 2007","Pixar are the computer boffins behind such great films as 'Toy Story', 'Finding Nemo' and 'The Incredible's' so it is with excitement I look forward to watching their new film 'Ratatouille', but I have to say that I was thoroughly disappointed. The idea is basically about a rat who longs to be one of the greatest chef's in the world, lucky then that he lives under Paris, unlucky that he is a rat. Basically that's it, there are no really cool characters like the turtles in 'Nemo' or the aliens in 'Toy Story', there is his unbelieving dad, fat brother, bumbling chef accomplice who are all quite unassuming the only one with anything to them is the evil head chef who runs the kitchen with an iron fist. There is none of the magic that made earlier films so appealing for young and old and the jokes are thin and far between or have been done before. I think the whole thing is let down by the idea, it just isn't as strong as previous outings. There's a loose theme of humans hating rats as they are pests but it never really gets of the ground and a kitchen doesn't really allow for many action sequences. The animation is as you'd expect flawless and the rats (despite being pests) are all fluffy cute so the kids will probably love them but all in all this is probably the worst film to come from the Pixar stable, which considering past achievements and their normal level of originality ends up being a bit more of a let down.","

"Ratatouille","elispaul","16 June 2007","One of the most wonderful things about a Pixar movie is the sense of discovery. The sense that, no matter how many commercials you've seen, no matter how much you've heard about the plot, you're going to discover hidden layers with each viewing that make the experience more of an event than a movie. Ratatouille fits this description to a tee. I went to the special sneak preview tonight and, honestly, I have not heard an audience this involved in a film since Finding Nemo four years ago and I would be thrilled if this movie found that large of an audience as well, because it certainly deserves it. There is a grace and a beauty to this movie that is present even in the physical comedy sequences. After a summer of sequels, how refreshing to see such a startlingly original story told so artistically with such a high level of humor and warmth. When it opens on June 29th, go see it. I know I'll be in line to see it again.","

That Brad Bird tries to pass off ratatouille as a casserole should tell you exactly what he thinks of those silly enough to shill out their money for his latest ""masterpiece""!But Bird-Brain lost me WAY before that! How does Remy know how to read? How can he identify foods he's never stuffed in his face? Granny blasts the holy hell out of her house to try to blast Remy and Emile to kingdom come?! Come on! And Remy just happens to wash up at his idol's restaurant? How convenient!If someone doesn't claim to be Gusteau's progeny within two years of his death, the place goes to Skinner. Huh? Gusteau (or at least his ghost) is shocked to learn that he actually has progeny (given just how porky this pig is, that really IS a shock)! It won't take a genius to figure out that Linguini is The Chosen One, but why would his mother disclose this to Skinner instead of to Gusteau's lawyer?When The Chosen One doesn't give Remy the credit he thinks he deserves at the press conference, he lets the colony have at the food! Having learned his ""lesson"", The Chosen One lets Ego in on who made his delicious ratatouille! All of this is beyond dumb!Which brings up another plot-hole-you-can-drive-a-tank-through: after the press conference, Linguini forces Remy to take a ""time out"". Remy returns to the restaurant, but after it's closed. How did Linguini manage to cook that night without Remy? Don't ask Bird-Brain that, or his little pinhead will explode!Ball-Busting-Bitch Colette falls for Girly-Man Linguini? LOL! The less said about the other idiotic clichés Bird-Brain tries to pass off as characters, the better.I can't believe the praise the critics heaped on this given the pretentious screed Bird-Brain shoehorns into Ego's review. The film looks spectacular, but, as Uncle Walt's ghost would have told Bird-Brain, the ""100% Animated"" tag he obnoxiously tacks on at the end does not mean 100% CGI!","

"Ratatouille","ntsci","25 July 2007","This film was a pure delight. I loved the juxtaposition of garbage eating rats and fine french cooking. I loved the idea of turning the nasty reputation of rats on its head and making one rat's quest to create the center of an amusing story.It was hilarious. Yes it was absurd, but then most of the funniest jokes are absurd -- what Disney used to call plausible impossibilities. I'm not sure if I'd group it into the top 250 films of all time... too many other great films, but it was a pure delight for a Sunday afternoon at the movies. It is by far the best film I've seen this year so far. My children (boys ages 8,11 & 14) all enjoyed it very very much.","

"Ratatouille","Astralan","2 July 2007","This is an interesting film for a subject. First off, its a Brad Bird film, which is hard to compete with. Secondly, it's a Pixar flick. Third, it's rated G! How many films this year so far have this rating that all genres actually can find positive comments about? The crew that produced this is enormous. The money that went into this would probably is phenomenal (but I can't find a price on the total yet). Disney and Pixar know a cash cow when they see one.However, something strange happened to me during my first viewing of this film: I found myself detached from it in some strange way. The color work was excellent, the texture and feel was superior, the characterization impeccable. So what was it? The movie works on all levels, but there is a subjective aspect that I think interferres with the total immersion in this instance: 1. Not many people have an affinity for wild rats (except Willard), and 2. A geek (with an American dialect) that ends up being a totally incompetent heir of a famous French chef. Sometimes it felt like Brad was attempting to fit a square peg into a round hole.Not that its a bad thing, this is definitely a treat for all ages. The plot is simple: Sewer rat with his higher olfactory abilities applies it to garnishing food to achieve top honors with local critics. The pace doesn't leave you wanting; the continuity doesn't leave you wondering; the beauty of the animation doesn't leave you skeptical. Really, I can't recommend this enough for anyone with or without a family. I just can't put my finger on it though... it just leaves me curious.Another thing... I alway like to comment on the audience reaction to it in the viewing audience: Even with all the kids, they were engaged and didn't squawk throughout the movie, but also there was a lack of genuine surprise or laughter at the more poignant comic events, which makes me feel I'm not alone in my thinking here. Rats. Food. Restaurants. Somehow, that just doesn't mix for me.","

"Ratatouille","vitaleralphlouis","7 July 2007","Rating this movie #44 in the all time best movie list is just plain silly; and adds to the suspicion that the integrity of the IMDb website is compromised by studio meddling (which IMDb can't prevent.) This picture was much better than CARS, but it's a high-mediocre film at best. Most of the characterizations, humor, etc offer nothing very original or new. We enjoyed this picture -- make no mistake -- but while Pixar offers the best of current day animation the overall quality of storytelling doesn't hold a candle to the work of Walt Disney.Hollywood stacks the deck in bragging about recent hits. It makes no sense to compare the box office of an era when adult tickets are $11; children $7.50 to such classics as SNOW WHITE which sold millions of tickets at 50 cents for adults and 25 cents for children. SNOW WHITE lasted 68 years so far, and isn't dead yet. Pixar's rat flick won't even be a memory by 2010.","

"Ratatouille","JumeirahSun","30 July 2007","""Ratatouille"" is Pixar's best film, animation-wise, to date. It is truly remarkable for its visual landscape, and the story is charming. I went to see it with my family, and we all enjoyed it.The rats, generally viewed as disgusting creatures, are rendered adorable, but not too unrealistic (Disneyfied), on screen. And Paris is recreated with Pixar's amazing animation--the chase across the boats on the Seine is particularly stunning. Scenes with cooking and dancing rats are also enjoyable. This film is worth watching for the quality of animation alone, but the exposition about cookery, the scenery of Paris, the cute characters, and the endearing storyline should provide entertainment for almost everyone.","

"Ratatouille","mollymormonbrat","2 July 2007","I remember the first time I ever saw a teaser for this movie. I thought it looked silly and I had to wonder just what Pixar and Disney were thinking. A rat wanting to get fancy Frency food. Please.But time went by, and cuter trailers appeared, and I found myself wanting to see the movie about the cute rat in the restaurant. So it came out and I had a free weekend.This is one of those movies where you spend the whole time thinking ""This is so good!"" while at the same time barely having enough time to think so as you are so caught up in the story and the stellar animation. It's subtle, heartfelt, and downright hilarious with a character-driven plot and so many themes I can't possibly count them all.Remy is a rat not altogether satisfied with his garbage-eating existence in the French countryside. He was born with an extreme sense of smell, which makes him useful to his colony when it comes to sniffing out rat poison--one of the many reasons his fellow rats despise humans. But Remy is fascinated by humans and their ability to create things, and eventually his interest leads him into the world of cooking when his nose becomes handy in blending flavors. A tragedy leads him to Paris, more specifically Gusteau's, the fallen-from-grace restaurant that had once belonged to the deceased chef Remy admired. Here he meets Linguini, an awkward young man who can't cook, and they figure they can help each other out.Do not be misled--this is far from being the only part of this incredible story. Rather there is a series of incidents created by a colorful cast of characters that leads us not only from movie's beginning to end but through some amazing character development and more plot events; it's infinitely better than contrived and forced plots that are so often shoved down our throats. This has many stories: the aforementioned, Remy's division between the worlds of rats and humans, an adorable love story between Linguini and a driven cook by the name of Collette, and that of Skinner, the new head chef determined to keep the restaurant under his own power. While we all love an intense character, ""Ratatouille"" keeps its players surprisingly realistic and subtle rather than making them into a circus of stereotypes. Admittedly, disbelief must be suspended in certain parts, but the story is so endearing and good that you are certainly willing to do so.The complexity of so many things is what make this film stand out. As Remy is torn between the worlds of humans and rats he is faced with the contradiction of what he is: a rat wanting to cook, but stealing food at the same time. Also there is the problem of Remy wanting credit, but neither wanting to lose his place in the world of gourmet. You must also notice the range between the fanciful talking rats and the realistic problems of wills and DNA testing. It works.I know I said I could not name the many themes circulating through this movie, but I must go at one. The title ""Ratatouille"" is not only a pun referring to the rodent characters, but is also a peasant dish never to be served at a fancy French restaurant. It's low, it's common, but as the movie shows can be more than any other food. This is a story about finding greatness in the ordinary.I feel this is one of Pixar's finest. It is a film that will stay with you long after it has finished.","

"Ratatouille","mrush","4 July 2007","The best moment for me in this movie came when it was over.This is a boringly bad movie from Disney-Pixar.A rat named Remy yearns to be a chef and he lives his dream by giving advice to an ungainly dishwasher in a snooty restaurant in Paris.The restaurant becomes the hottest place to eat and the young man becomes the toast of Paris.Now the animation is top notch,perhaps the best Pixar animation ever but what kills this film is the script.It isn't funny at best and is just plain dull at worst.I was wanting to like this film.Patton Oswalt,who voiced Remy,is a awfully funny stand-up comedian and I was hoping some of that would be displayed in this film.But it wasn't.You might as well had some Joe from off the street voicing Remy because there was no comedy to be had in this film.Oswalt was stifled by the terrible writing as was all the other people who gave voice to the characters.I never laughed once during this film and actually don't remember even smiling either.I wasn't alone.Very few folks in the sparse audience found anything to laugh at either.How this film is getting all these great reviews I haven't a clue.It must be folks who are grooving on the animation and aren't paying attention that the storyline and script are terrible.If I hadn't been bored to near sleep by this movie I would have gotten up and left before it was over.This movie stinks like bad cheese.","

It is about a rat named remy who wants to be a cook more than anything. But you know being a RAT and all its not that simple. So he befriends a human named linguini who works at gusteau's restaurant as a garbage boy and they slowly but surly work out a way to make this odd partnership work. That's all I will say about the plot of the movie but it also has a lot of deep messages that will get you thinking but instead of me rambling on just go watch the movie already!I hope this is good.

"Ratatouille","alec_willard","19 October 2007","Brad Bird's latest creation takes place in Paris, the city that is thought by many to be the city of the worlds greatest food. However, there are some problems. Mainly, that our hero, Remy (Patton Oswalt), is a rat. A rat that is a brilliant chef with a taste for fine food, but a rat none the less. Running from a mad old granny with a shotgun, being separated from his family, being flushed down one of the biggest pipes EVER! and being followed by the ghost of the late, great Gusteau, the chef that says ""Anyone can cook"", are just some of the problems the poor rat has to face. While this is a sweeping statement, a food critic named Anton Ego (voiced brilliantly by Peter O'Toole) takes it a bit too literally,making sure Gusteau's restaurant isn't as popular as it was. When Remy meets Linguini (Lou Romano), a terrible garbage boy/wannabe chef, he takes him under his wing (rat paw) and controls him through a strange method of pulling his hair??? The film has an excellent screenplay, amazing animations, brilliant art and mostly superb voices. The rats, normally horrible and dirty, are cute and clean. Brad Bird's screenplay is rich with jokes (Remy waves to a cyclist, who, disgusted, isn't looking where he's going and crashes into a car in a cloud of shopping and bike parts), passion (Linguini's love, Colette) and tiny details which would amaze even the greatest director (Remy's oven-glove bed, the rat poison/exterminator shop, Gusteau's ghost telling Remy what to do). It's all there, you've just got to look for it.There is only one bad thing about 'Ratatouille'. The character and voice of Languini, is in my opinion, not as fantastic as the rest of the film. Lou Romano doesn't quite seem to hit the right note, one brick short of a house or whatever you want to say. Linguini's character is too whiny, even for someone in his position. If he whines about the cooking, and at some points Remy, ditch the rat and go get a different job. He just doesn't seem to have his heart in it to me.Peter O'Toole, Ian Holm, Patton Oswalt and all the others, however, make it a very grand dish indeed. Patton Oswalt relies mainly on ear twitching and eyebrow raising, but when he does talk, you listen. Ian Holm, the small, evil chef who need a stool to taste soup, is, as ever, brilliant and Peter O'Toole seems to relish being the bad guy, just as Anton Ego loves to criticise the lack of relish (forgive the pun, had to be done...and the rhyme!). Dark, mysterious and even scary, Peter O'Toole brings an edge to another great Pixar villain. All in all, the film is a masterpiece, definitely Pixar's and Brad Bird's best dish yet, but hopefully there is more to come. Consider it a starter, an ""amuse de bouche"", and just wait for Pixar's next dish, whatever it is, and hope it's just as delicious . In the words of Anton Ego, ""Surprise me!"". Parents, just hope your kid's don't want a rat","

"Ratatouille","MihaiSorinToma","5 October 2018","Remy, an apparently ordinary rat who lives with his pack in a remote house, discovers that he has an extraordinary gift. He is able to smell all flavors and poisons, thus becoming very useful for his kind, but this new ability also comes with a lot of curiosity regarding food and cooking. This curiosity, bound to get him in trouble, ultimately sends him to Paris where it was thought that anybody can cook. There, he teams up with a very odd human with a ""special"" life of his own, in an attempt to prove his extraordinary abilities. He has a lot of work to do and many obstacles to overcome but his determination and skill will help him in many difficult situations.It's a superb animation which presents a beautiful, interesting and suspenseful life story which ultimately ends with style besides all problems the main characters have to face. It's beautifully animated, it has everything you can want from a movie, drama, suspense, romance and action while keeping your attention and interest all the time. Simply put, it's an animation masterpiece and a very good movie which I warmly recommend to anyone looking for a good time. Simply brilliant!","

"Ratatouille","dbborroughs","30 June 2007","The story of Remy a rat with a unique sense of taste and smell who wants nothing more than to cook. Ending up in Paris at the restaurant run by his idol Remy links up with a garbage boy named Linguini in the quest for culinary greatness.Sue me I'm not in love with this film. Certainly the voice cast is great with a wonderful turn by Peter O'Toole and another by Ian Holm, and the animation pushes American animation farther than its gone before but the story was too unfocused and too much of been there done that.I'm a heathen I know but while I was watching this all I could think of was where I had seen this before from Looney Tunes to Pinky and The Brain to Peter Greenaway to Fantasia 2000 to Iron Giant to I don't know how many other films that seem to have been cribbed from. I don't mind borrowing but please don't give me the time to notice all of the riffs as I'm watching the movie. Clearly I've seen way too many movies for my own good since so much of this film seems borrowed.Its doesn't help that to me the film is unfocused for much of its running time. Once the film gets set in motion and Remy is introduced the film sort of staggers about trying to find its footing. There is no real conflict of consequence until the final half hour. Certainly there is the question of whether Remy and Linguini will make a team, but its not much of a threat since you know how it will have to play out, and the same can be said for Ian Holm's Skinner who is such a non threat that they have to add in a couple of out of left field plot twists just to keep things going (The letter from Linguini's mother and all that follows). Its not until Peter O'Toole's food critic resurfaces in the final reels that the film really begins to fire on all cylinders.This isn't to say its a bad film, it not, its just not the spectacular one that everyone sees in its animated frames. There are some great set pieces, the escape from the farm is wonderful for example, that are wonderfully animated pieces of art. And with out a doubt the final sequences as Remmy and Linguini have to come up with a plan to over come the ""evil"" O'Toole are some of Brad Birds best work, but it comes at the end of a long meandering journey, which both lifts whats gone before and diminishes whats there.I like the film, probably more than I realize (hence the 7 out of 10 rating) but I'm not in love with it.","

"Ratatouille","danjakubik","4 July 2007","""Ratatouille"" (2007) / Directed and written by: Brad Bird ****(Excellent) This is one of the best animated films I've ever seen. Though it's largely a comedy, it ranks up there with some of Disney's best work, including Snow White, Bambi and Pinnochio. As usual, the Pixar digital animation is excellent and always improving in some small way with each new film. The step forward for this film, is water and how it's depicted in a very realistic manner. That's the small technical leap here. However, this is a rare film (of any genre), where all the right elements are done very well and all come together to make a unique and special film.""Ratatouille"" is a film with some surprisingly sly, sophisticated humor that goes beyond the expectations of the usual animated film. There's a surprisingly well written, humorous and touching story here, that probably connects better with adults than with children. Though there's plenty of action and humor children will find appealing, the humor and finer peaks of the story are more aimed at adults. I've rarely seen a film rated G that contains with such creativity and sophistication.A young man begins work in a famous restaurant in Paris. Here he accidentally meets and befriends a unique rat that was discovered in the restaurant kitchen. This young man has a secret connection to the restaurant. This unique rat has an affection for fine food and a talent for food preparation. It's a story idea that doesn't seem to hold much promise to hold adult attention and interest for the length of a feature film. However, there are a number of factors that strengthen the story, such as well conceived and voiced characters and a fine attention to visual detail. The look of Paris and food preparation is done with remarkable authenticity. The distinguished actor Peter O' Toole provides the voice of a hard hearted and egotistical restaurant critic. This character looks and sounds like a villain, however the real villain of the story turns out to be the current chef of the restaurant.Two of the best scenes of the film are when the current chef is getting the young man drunk on wine, in order for him to divulge his secrets of success. The other scene is when the hard hearted restaurant critic suddenly has a childhood flashback upon tasting one of the restaurants famous creations prepared in a new way.Though I think children will generally find this an entertaining film, it's adults who will most appreciate it's sophisticated, sly humor and amazing visual details. In an audience largely of families, I noticed a sometimes bewildered look on the face of a young girl sitting next to me during the film. It was at this time that adults better connected with the film than children.Not to forget the lively music score, which really supports the humor and dramatic moments of the film. The film editing provides the right pace and rhythm all throughout the film.Overall, ""Ratatouille"" celebrates the preparation of and enjoyment of fine food with a surprisingly well conceived and written story and characters. This film deserves two Oscar nominations: Best Original Screenplay and Best Animated Feature Film.Highly Recommended.","

"Ratatouille","Danusha_Goska","1 July 2007","""Ratatouille"" is adorable. Remy, the lead character, a rat gourmet cook, is noble, sweet, and endearing.The animation is top notch: beautiful, detailed, appearing to be three dimensional. Paris was never lovelier.I laughed several times, and even cried once, when a character is served a meal that brings back memories of his childhood.There is one chase scene after another. The rat is menaced by much larger human beings; he escapes. This is repeated several times.Given all the chase scenes, there isn't much time left for character development. Linguini, a cook, announces he is in love; when did that happen? And Remy, though the main character, does not grow or change at all. He cooks; he escapes; he cooks; he escapes.All these chase scenes leave little room for the kind of magic, time out of time moments found in cartoon classics: the dance in the ballroom from ""Beauty and the Beast,"" the spaghetti dinner or ""midnight howl"" from ""Lady and the Tramp,"" the dance of the mushrooms from ""Fantasia."" The villain, Skinner, a short, dark-skinned, cook, is uninteresting. His major crime seems to be promoting fast food. ""Supersize Me"" did a much better job of skewering fast food. There are a lot of truly terrifying cartoon villains out there: Cruella de Ville, the witch queen in ""Snow White."" Skinner is not in their class. Skinner is a nice name for a villain, here. Skinner is, of course, the last name of B. F. Skinner, the behaviorist famous for experimenting on rats, and for his book title, ""Beyond Freedom and Dignity.""Brad Bird, who also wrote ""The Incredibles,"" favors excellence and individuality, themes that run counter to Skinner's theories. So, his bad guy is named ""Skinner,"" a very un-French name in a Parisian setting. ""Ratatouille,"" like too many animated films, is a man's world. There is only one female character, and she is underdeveloped.I loved the beauty of this film's animation, but it isn't a classic, to me. There just aren't those moments where the action stops, and I get in touch with the heart and soul of a living, growing, character. And the all-male Paris -- both its rats and its humans are viritually all male -- is too grim in its obvious message.","

One will notice many big name voices in the movie. Brian Dennehey and James Remar are heard. Peter O'toole is the voice of the food critic. The underdog theme of many children tales is well done.

And, indeed, there are times when the pacing does tend to drag a bit even for more seasoned moviegoers like myself. Still, the action scenes are palpitating in their energy and excitement, and even those jaded by the unimaginable strides made in CGI technology over the years will be properly bowled over by what the filmmakers have managed to pull off here. The sheer fluidity of movement alone in this film is draw-dropping in its impressiveness. The story is rather less compelling overall, but one has to admire Bird's willingness to keep the drama at least somewhat intimate and life-sized. The price of that subtlety, however, is that the movie is also a trifle dull in spots.The film is highly blessed with energetic voice work by the likes of Patton Oswalt, Ian Holm, Lou Romano, Brad Garrett, Peter O'Toole, and, above all, Janeane Garofalo as a high-strung, up-and-coming chef who doesn't take too kindly to fresh-out-of-the-oven competitors encroaching on her territory.But it is the exquisitely designed backdrops that finally make ""Ratatouille"" a thing of joy and beauty.

"Ratatouille","thespeos","29 June 2022","Generally, I don't like animation. But this is so realistic, and the characters (voices) can be very funny.Here's my breakdown:STORY:
A rat who is an exceptional chef ... yes, that's a unique story. You could argue that being an animation means
you don't have to have a good story, but I disagree - animation or not, we always require good story for good film.If this was done with people I'm not sure it would be half as good (if even possible). So the realism here allows
for an engaging story that expresses itself in some very touching ways (almost human).And it's very funny.ACTING:
The ""acting"" is good, but the lead character was so real ... almost like the film ""Tron"" (1982) that he was a marvel
to watch. Very nice ""cast"" though somewhat cliched.ENTERTAINMENT:
For kids, this is high value. Adults? Depends, but I'd bet you'll enjoy it too.TEMPO:
As with so many Disney films (modern), the pace is often far too hectic and loud for me. Otherwise it's fine.CINEMATOGRAPHY:
Very nice for a cartoonDIRECTING / WRITING:
Director: I just can't assess / critique animation direction except to say this was high-quality work.Writers: As mentioned above, this was a unique and well-crafted story.Is it a good film? Yes.Should you watch this once? Yes.Rating: 8.0.","

"Ratatouille","mirosuionitsaki2","23 July 2007","During the first few minutes of the movie, perhaps ten, I thought, ""Looks like this is going to be a dull movie of the life of a rat."" Viewing more of the movie, I think, ""This movie can be believable. Anyone can cook."" This movie does kind of give you that message. That's what the movie is basically about, showing a rat cooking.This was a fantastic movie to see! I really love how the setting is widely based in Paris, and all the characters have a French accent. Everything seems better that way. You can tell someone lives in Paris instead of speaking English without the accent. If that were to happen, it ruins the entire movie.It's funny how the rat didn't know that he has been living under Paris the entire time. Since at first, he and his clan lived in the house of an old lady, who seems to be having a lot of plants near her which could have given you the idea she was living somewhere in the country. Now that I have seen more, that idea is lost and they're living in Paris.I thought it was clever how the rat could control the guy with his hair like a joystick. It seemed so original. I also love this human and pet relationship. It's cute and heartwarming. Other than the typical movies about a dog and a boy and the boy passes up a one billion deal just so he can keep the dog because he's family. If that were to happen it would be so pathetic I would cry.I recommend this movie for everyone, young and old! Unless you are offended or disgusted by rodents, then do not watch this movie because that's basically the main spice of the story. This movie is what you can say, a five star movie. Actually, a nine star since the personality of the chef is too similar, also the critic. Seems like something you would find in too many movies.. the personality.","

I'm not sure, and Pixar itself seems to have lowed down its standards here, in order to be more in a classical Disney's tradition.Don't get me wrong, some ideas are brilliant : especially when the rat ""pupetmastered"" the human, or the touching ending with the critic's critic, or the Head Cheaf's characters, who is very funny, etc. But somehow, the story - and especially the human's parts, who seems paradoxically less human than the fishes, the monsters or the toys of other's movies - lack of the deep you normally supposed to find in a Pixar movie. The mousse tries to hides inside a rat's figure, but you still can see the disneyen's hears of the animal. The all moral aspect is for instance very shallow (and furthermore, it's almost Shrek one : no matter what you are, if you try hard enough, you can become what you truly are).Of course, it's far better than the last other's American animation's studio's recent works, but its far more childish than, say, ""The Incredibles"", witch was directed by the same Brad Bird. I also was quite disappointed by ""Cars"", and I have the feeling that Pixar's singularity and originality is a little lost, replaced by the dominant classical Disney's moral. Well, at least, this years, 2-D animation brings me ""The Simpsons : The movie"", and I'm gonna watch it one more time, waiting for the sequel more than the next Pixar's movie. PS : For Animation's fans and movies'lovers, ""Persepolis"" is also a must-see of the year : there's more than American's 3D in the cartoon's life...","

"Ratatouille","sini-200","1 August 2023","Ratatouille is Pixar's best work done yet! Just simply perfect. It's one of those movies that you can watch over and over again, even as adult or child.It has that beautiful aesthetic vibe to it with the pretty French landscape and deliciously looking food, and the beautiful city views of Paris. The music is fantastic and honestly heals the soul. The message of Ratatouille is to inspire for: you can do anything you set your mind to, your only limit is our soul.The characters are inspiring and also funny. Linguini is funny and relatable being awkward. Skinner is the perfect ""villain"" of the movie. Anton Ego as the cold food critic who has a heart after all.","

"Ratatouille","diogo_mmj","4 January 2023","Remy, a simple mouse, dreams of being a cook. One day he meets Linguine, the assistant of a decadent restaurant, who doesn't have the slightest talent for cooking. The two combine to use Remy's cooking skills to regain the restaurant's prestige.Ratatouille is an animation of Pixar's finest stage. Before the company started making sequels, spin offs and repeating itself (as in the similarities between the spirit world of ""inside out"" and ""soul"").Here the story is extremely original and doesn't underestimate the intelligence of the audience. Despite many funny scenes, Ratatouille reminds us that the mouse is a sewer animal, not a friendly pet. Then we have the central conflict of the protagonist. The animation also pays homage to French culture, with the reconstitution of Paris, the culinary tradition and the friendly chansons. This background wall gives the film a charm.Technically the film is brilliant. Even though it was made almost twenty years ago, the animation could have been released yesterday. The film's atmosphere changes day, night, bright rooms, dark streets, rain, sun. Without losing quality. The camera movement is frantic and absolutely brilliant, following the little mouse's agile steps in places only a mouse could go.Ratatouille has several educational messages: appearances don't matter, an artist can come from anywhere, you have to step out of your comfort zone, etc.One of the best animations ever made. 9/10.","

"Ratatouille","RCWjr","6 July 2007","It is one thing to take the animation up a notch, as the film does fantastically. But they have also increased the sophistication of the story telling.Right on par with Bird's other films for Disney/Pixar, Ratatouille makes excellent use of characters and story. There is enough to keep the kids entertained (the usual Pratt falls, chases, etc), as well as an ever growing sophisticated humor and story telling that opens up the general audience to enjoy the film, not just the kids.Back in the 2nd golden age of animation (mid-late 80's to late 90's) Disney was able to tap into a wider audience by providing state of the art animation with more complex stories. As the computer age was ushered in, once again Disney rose to the occasion a long with Pixar. Though with their last outing CARS, they took a step back, here with Ratatouille they regain the momentum again.The strange thing about Ratatouille is there is no easily marketable tie-in toy. Of course, that hasn't stopped the Disney folks from trying to peddle stuffed rats. But for the first time a film of theirs has to totally sell itself by story alone and that makes this a very successful movie in my opinion. It does succeed without the tie-in.Voice work across the board is spot on. There are no highly recognizable actors lending voice talent to remove you from the world. Ratatouille creates a world that you stay within. This could bring about similar voice casting in the future where some known voices are used, but the leads, as is the case here, are filled with mostly unknowns.Great job overall!","

"Ratatouille","bobbobwhite","6 July 2007","Only Waitress was a better film overall for me as it was real people, but Ratty was close, and both were great. Both were so original, inspired, visual, great stories, well acted, funny....all the good things that make us know movies can still can be great. Disney struck gold when Jobs sold it Pixar...the gift that just keeps on giving. Great entertainment to us, bags of money to Disney.What great voices, especially notable was Peter O'Toole as villain-turned-good guy Anton Ego..... he was perfectly egotistical and snobby as a scary food critic. The story...who doesn't like food? The inner workings of a busy French kitchen was fun and interesting. The animation showed continued tech improvement as nuances and shadings and physical movements are getting so much better and more realistic with tech advances. God is in the details in animation, that's for sure.Loved it throughout, if you could overlook all the kid chaos and noise in the theater on the first day. Any lesser film would have been disturbed by the incredible din. Everyone loved it, with much applause at the end.Do yourself a favor and see it in a theater. See the vast improvements in animation and color, but not just for that...see it for the great and touching story of a rat that appreciated great food over the garbage his friends and family liked, and due to that love he made sure he became a part of the haute cuisine world forever. We are all better off for it.See Waitress and Once also, if you haven't. All three are terrific films, and prove that summer fare doesn't have to be lame.","

"Ratatouille","Thunderbuck","30 June 2007","I love Pixar. As a studio they have created a new form of cinema that grows and evolves with every new film they make. In fact, I'd say that if I had the chance to work for any company in the world, Pixar would be it, even if it was just to empty the trash.What I've admired most about Pixar movies is that story has always been of the utmost importance; technology has always been used to serve the story, not the other way around.Being the Pixar fan that I am, I was looking forward to RATATOUILLE, particularly since director Brad Bird did such a wonderful job with THE INCREDIBLES, and I'm sort of a sucker for ""follow your dream"" stories to begin with. The idea of a rat who dreams of cooking in a Paris restaurant sounded just goofy enough to work.On a lot of levels, RATATOUILLE does work. Bird was clearly ambitious here, with an obvious affection for food, Paris, and good restaurants. The kitchen he renders here is beautifully detailed and Bird even manages to sneak in a little tour that faithfully describes the various positions. Visually, there is a lovely warmth to this movie; who could have foreseen 10 years ago that CG animation could do justice to the City of Light? The weakness here is in the story. And it's not that the story is bad--it's orders of magnitude better than, say, SHREK THE THIRD--just not strong enough to support director Bird's ambitions. There is little real sense of peril here, and the characters aren't terribly well-developed.I enjoyed RATATOUILLE, even admired much of it, but Pixar needs to sharpen its story skills if it wants to stay at the top of the heap.","

"Ratatouille","freemantle_uk","1 March 2009","Brad Bird, a member of the Simpsons team in its early days and the writer and director of the Iron Giant and the Incredibles. Pixar studios have made some of the best animated films ever, film Toy Story to the Wall-E, only missing the mark once. Pixar is the only Hollywood studio that can get away with such uncinematic material.The plot focuses on Remy (Patton Oswalt), a rat from rural France who has a highly developed sense of taste and smell. He is obsessed with cooking and after getting separated from his colony ends up in the centre of Paris. He goes to the result of his ideal Auguste Gusteau who had recently died. He watches the kitchen staff work and sees the new garbage boy Linguini (Lou Romano) nearly ruining the soap of the day. Remy goes in to the kitchen an starts to make a tasty, but gets caught by Linguini. However, Linguini comes up with the idea that the two can work in a team and the young man becomes a cooking celebrity in France. However, the team have to take on the villainous the head-chef Skinner (Ian Holm) who used Auguste Gusteau's image to sell cheap frozen dinners. During the film Remy and Linguini suffer the highs and lows of celebrity and cookery and friendship, strain loyalties and romance, as well as tacking the evil Skinner and having to please the Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole), the toughest food critic in Paris.The animation is beautiful, which is what you expect from a Pixar film, but there is more then that. In Ratatouille there are characters you care about, good voice acting, a strong plot, great designs and a lot of research was conducted. This was a film made from love. The humour is mostly slapstick, but it's a kid film, so you expect it and it's good slapstick. There were also good visual and verbal jokes. The best humour involves the mass of rats. I also thought that the hard-as-nails female chef Collette (Janeane Garofalo) was an excellent comic creation. There is also some dark humour and jokes for adults. However there is one scene which may upset very young or sensitive children, but most will like it.I admit I prefer the Incredibles, but Ratatouille is an excellent follow up by Brad Bird and I would like him to either do a sequel for the Incredibles or work as the Simpsons show runner just to sort out the once great show.Fantastic film.","

"Ratatouille","toclement","7 September 2007","Geez, IMDb has become incredibly unreliable. There used to be a time that a high rating for a movie meant something. Nowadays it's pretty much standard fare for anything that's popular. This movie, while I can see why many would like it, is average at best. Too many people with undiscerning taste coming in here and giving 10s to every movie they watch.As fort he movie: Predictable, formulaic American/Hollywood approach to animation. Not very funny either (I think I gave a minor chuckle once). I'd give it a 3 or 4, but given all the 10s given by people who probably don't even watch many movies outside the Hollywood establishment.Oh a cute little rat! He acts like people! He talks! He has emotion! He loves his family! Give that baby a 10! And let's give American accents to all the main characters, so that the movie doesn't feel like it's really set in France.","

"Ratatouille","msco89","28 June 2007","I work at a local theater and have seen all of the sub-par crap that studios have been sending us to watch. I caught an early showing because I work there and went in with the feeling that it might be like Shrek: The Third or any of the other ""okay"" animated films I have seen in the past year. This movie is so different. It feels like you are watching a live action movie that has been painted with cartoon colors and textures. Everything is meant to look real and at the same time fictional. The characters seem more human than in most cartoons and more time is spent developing the attributes and emotions of each character. The part where they learn how to cook with each other is quite hilarious. You see the bond forming between the two, not like most cartoons where the characters seem to just get along out of nowhere. I recommend this feature to everyone, with the exception of really little kids(ages 4 and under). This has nothing to do with content, but it seems more mature than most Pixar/Disney films and they might lose attention quickly. Also the film is almost two hours long.....so prepare for a lengthier adventure than most!!!!","

"Ratatouille","VincentVega89","1 July 2007","After the disappointment that was Cars, I thought that Pixar's creative magic had finally depleted. It's not that Cars was a bad film, it was good, but it wasn't up to par compared to the other Pixar classics. Now with Ratatouille I have to say that the magic of Pixar is alive and well. The film plotwise is just terrific. The story is well done and the characters are all hilarious. The humor is smart, funny, and original. The humor is one of the reasons that sets Pixar apart from Dreamworks and it's competitors There are no fart jokes in Ratatouille, and some of the best jokes reside in the dialogue. I would give an example, but I wouldn't want to ruin one of the brilliant scenes in the film. The characters are all interesting and lovable. Technically Ratatouille is amazing. While the characters are cartoonish the actual backgrounds are nearly photorealistic. This is truly a film to see on the big screen because the film has outstanding particle effects. The water looks like real water, and the fur on the rats look real. It is true eye candy and perfectly complements the story.One of the major themes in Ratatouille is the combination of tastes. And with the juicy plot and sweet effects Ratatouille is a scrumptious treat. This is a work of art and is a true classic. To call this film Best Animated Feature would be an insult. For this film isn't the Best Animated Feature of 2007 but the Best film of 2007.Pixar has always been the leader in CGI films, and Ratatouille just shows that Pixar is still the best.","

"Ratatouille","tavm","30 June 2007","Ratatouille is another highly enjoyable Pixar/Disney animated feature film that should do very well at the box office in its opening weekend. Having just said that, I must admit that the constant laughs I was expecting mainly seemed to come in fits and starts. Despite that, however, I found the story very enjoyable especially near the end when All is revealed. I found myself crying when that came so this movie definitely touched me on some level. Now that I think about it, I can't think of anything I would cut out or shorten so if the humor doesn't always flow smoothly, when the laughs come from me or the audience I feel they are deserved for the most part. Loved the scenes involving the old lady discovering the rats in her house and her attempts to shoot them all. Loved the constant weird movements involving the garbage-boy-turned-chef-with-a-rat-in-him that made the other staff look at him. And definitely loved the relationship between that garbage boy and the rat Remy and the way they cooperated together. Not to mention Remy's constant speaking to an image of his idol, Gusteau. So while not the funniest Pixar feature (The first Toy Story probably deserves that distinction), Ratatouille is certainly one of the most touching. So on that note, I definitely recommended it.","

"Ratatouille","etsm92","1 July 2007","Ratatouille/2007/***1/2Main Stars: Remy: Patton Oswalt Linguini: Lou Romano Skinner: Ian Holm Colette: Janeane Garofalo Gusteau: Brad GarrettDuring and especially after this film I was hungry. The film had very convincing food; I'll give you that. You know why? Because the animation was truly brilliant! So much detail put in Pixar Animation Studios has started a reputation to now release a Pixar film every summer and they still convince, compel, enchant, etc. with their brilliant animation, clever scenes and compelling story. It's truly amazing to me how they can release a film every year and still be able to maintain an intrinsic beauty! As for Ratatouille, it filled my expectations more so than I thought. I had read a couple of critics' reviews and they were not mixed. The unanimous was good. One gave it three stars. Another gave it three and a half stars. And finally four stars. So I thought I don't know what to expect. Although the unanimous rating was good, that doesn't mean that that three could have been for animation purposes so it was only mildly recommended. So I told myself to remain sober throughout the entire film regardless of what other people say. And, as a result of NOT expecting it to be great like most Pixar films are, I was very impressed. Good job, Pixar. And mainly, good job, writer and director Brad Bird, whose The Incredibles was also extremely impressive. He showed his unrecognized talent once again! One other thing that spit at me to remain sober throughout the film was the preview for it. The preview didn't make it look very good and I'm actually glad. I think that previews shouldn't spoil films. Some films release the previews that have the funny parts already in them. So, when you see the movie, you don't like it as much as you should have because you have already seen a funny scene! Not for this film. But the previews were good enough to have me checkin' the film out and not to be completely turned away. The basic premise I found interesting and the movie proved that even more. But what is the basic premise? It's actually kind of odd. But there is nothing wrong with oddity, is there? It's what makes the world revolve on its very axis. And something like Ratatouille is something you don't see every day. Good. No clichés. It's about this rat named Remy (Patton Oswalt). He is the more motivated of the rats in the rat colony he is in. His ingenuity in cooking is what motivates him and makes him want to do more. So soon he visits actual Paris, leaving his family and friends behind. He never knew he lived in Paris until he finally was inspired by a future friend and restaurant owner Gusteau (Brad Garrett) and had enough courage to leave the sewer, climb a tall building and be surprised to see the Eifel Tower. How much more revealing can you get that you're in Paris than seeing that? He then awkwardly meets with a young adult looking for a job named Linguini (Lou Romano). Remy then becomes the chef behind the hat. Although continually being spied on by the fastidious head chef Skinner (Ian Holm), he still continues to do well at what he does best and practices and practices with his chef acquaintance. Linguini's personal feelings start to bloom for a Miss Colette (Janeane Garofalo) later on. On worse news, he doesn't seem to have what it takes to be a chef and that gets a little hard on him after a while. Food critics come in and out and continue to rate the restaurant good or bad. Before Linguini was hired, the restaurant had lost a star and then another from the insanely picky, arrogant food critic named Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole). Although a secondary character, Ego is also a vital character in the film that not only proves the moral of the film, but also proves one of the morals of life. And I, as a film critic, need to keep some of the lessons learned in this film myself and learn from my mistakes as well. Maybe I won't learn my mistakes by eating some food but maybe I'll learn by watching an impressive, enjoyable film like this one. Movie directed by Brad Bird.","

"Ratatouille","mikezexcel","3 August 2007","What is it with the excessive overpraise for movies under the Pixar banner? I'll admit the company reinvigorated interest in animated movies a decade ago with photo-realistic visuals, clever characters, witty scenarios, and decent stories. Little of that was evident in RATATOUILLE. This movie was stale, uninspired, overlong and lacking in creativity.Everyone knows the premise by now: a rat works undercover as a chef in a fancy restaurant to prove that ""anyone"" can be a great chef if they want to. We know this theme because it is repeated ad nauseum to stretch out a movie that has nothing else to offer. That is not the only idea that is repeated over and over again. Cooking scenes, the rat being hunted and chased by the head chef, the love/hate dynamics between the two ""human"" leads, all make you wonder when we'll see anything new before the movie ends. We don't; the story just limps to its foregone conclusion.About the animation: Done in CGI hyper-realism, it elicits a ""wow, that bubbling pot looks just like a photo"" admiration that lasts about 5 minutes. By contrast, the end credits are accompanied by '60's-style Disney animation, and it is much more interesting. Maybe it's time for Pixar to turn the clock back.","

"Ratatouille","dwpeak","9 July 2007","RATATOUILLE**** stars out of 5 (8/10).I can say, with little doubt, that ""Ratatouille"" is the best film I've seen all summer long. It mixes brilliant animation with good, old-fashioned film-making.Remy (PATTON OSWALT) is a strange rat. He prefers fine cuisine to the trash his family usually eats. He is also different in the fact that he can read, and cook the food he loves so dearly. Remy is eventually separated from his family, and he must find his way to survive in Paris, the fine food capitol of the world. One day, he is caught in a famous restaurant by Linguini (LOU ROMANO), the new garbage boy. Before he's about to dump Remy in the river, Linguini sees that the rat understands his words. Earlier, he saw the rat cooking up delicious soup, so he puts his head to work. The two unlikely friends begin to work together, so Remy can be a cook, and so Linguini can move up in the world of the restaurant business.This movie is smart, witty, and stunning to the eye. Brad Bird is a master of animation, and this is his best film to date. The movie can be quite funny, without going over the top on pop-culture references. It's so well-made that it makes some of the other summer pictures look like nothing. The animation is intricate, colorful, and comically realistic. It's scary the amount of detail the filmmakers went into. ""Ratatouille"" is a feast to the senses, and it finds a way of entertaining you throughout the entire movie.I won't do much complaining, but there are some little things I wasn't happy about. For once, I would like to see an animated movie without this kind of villain, and the stages of predictability he/she goes through to find out the scheme. Don't get me wrong, I liked the character Skinner (IAN HOLM), but the process has been in nearly every animated movie of late. It was directed well, but I guess I just want to see something new.Nonetheless, this film reaches a certain amount of greatness. The voice casting is perfect, and it will associate with all kinds of audiences. It's a flavor explosion, and you would be without taste not to enjoy this great Pixar dish.","

"Ratatouille","moutonbear25","28 June 2007","Rats are a hard sell. They're filthy little rodents with fierce, ugly teeth that scurry across your feet when you aren't expecting anything, dragging their long, scaly tails behind them and sending those they cross into squeals of fear. Rats in a kitchen comedy are arguably an impossible sell. If you don't like rats to begin with, you certainly don't want them anywhere near your food. Yet here we are smack in the middle of the premise for the near infallible Pixar's latest summer crowd pleaser, RATATOUILLE. Separated from his rat colony, Remy (voiced by comedian Patton Oswalt), finds himself accidentally putting his culinary talents to good use in what was once one of Paris' most prestigious kitchens, earning him rave reviews. Of course a rat can't take credit for fine food preparation so he forms an unlikely friendship with a gangly, awkward fellow by the name of Linguini (Lou Romano), who serves as his front. Together they bring new life to an aging restaurant and inspire each other to be better than they believe themselves to be. The folks at Pixar might have been sniffing too many expensive cheeses when they concocted this mousecapade but they may also be the only people out there who could have pulled it off. Only, under the writing and direction of Brad Bird (THE INCREDIBLES), they didn't just pull it off; RATATOUILLE is a masterwork in the field of animated film-making, deliciously reaching heights that no rat has ever reached before.Remy is no ordinary rat. He has a gift, a gift that is being squandered at home. He understands the complicated calibration of cooking. He knows the spice for every occasion yet his overbearing father (Brian Dennehy) uses his heightened senses as a tool to sniff out rat poison amongst the garbage. Like so many of us born into situations that do not lead instantly to fame and fortune, Remy is destined for greatness but has yet to be discovered. Not only does he need to win over the hearts and stomachs of notoriously finicky food critics (like the one voiced so delectably by Peter O'Toole) but he must also win over the potentially lost appetites of modest movie goers who may not want rats with the their popcorn. Bird's animators studied the bahavior of rats extensively and felt it would be best to have the rats walk about like humans, on two feet, in an effort to appear more likable. Bird refused. He wanted the rats to act like rats. He wanted their ideals to win us over. When trapped in a jar early on in the film, it is Remy's charm that gets him set free. There is an earnestness, a yearning, a hope seen deep in his pleading eyes that reminds us just how often we find ourselves trapped in jars by people bent on keeping us down. Besides, aren't we all just rats in the race?Like Remy, Bird and his Pixar cohorts know to add a sprinkling of depth to their dishes and that presentation is key. RATATOUILLE raises the Pixar standard of beauty to new levels while seasoning the whole with hints of meaning that are only completely realized once they hit your palette. Pixar's Paris is a foggy riverside with scattered street lamps at one moment and a string of window lights and fountains the next. While it is romantically distracting, it is nowhere near as chaotic as the view from two inches above the floor. Rats scamper and the camera follows as Remy swerves in and out of kitchen crevasses and sewers (always sure to wash his hands before touching the food). The fluidity of the movement through such luscious colour is hypnotic and mag ical, simply what one would expect from the city of love. Somewhere tucked away in this city is a tiny one-bedroom apartment the size of a storage space known as not much but still home to Linguini. The friendship formed between the man and his rat is unlikely, yes, but it anchors the film with its humbling mutual appreciation. They learn to rely on each other without forgetting how to contribute the most vital parts of themselves. Theirs is a friendship so powerful and so respectful that it changes the minds and hearts of the naysayers who play witness to it, including those sitting comfortably in front of the screen.""Anyone can cook."" These are the words of Chef Gousteau, Remy's inspiration and hero, that run throughout RATATOUILLE. Cooking can be interpreted as anything and therefore anyone can do anything they want. Just look at Remy, a rat with an impossible dream that comes true despite every odd and thanks to hard work (and a dash of fate). Better yet, just look at Pixar. By not simply following the recipe but rather using inspired, unusual ingredients, they have managed to make a mesmerizing masterpiece that is astonishing, endearing and about a rat.GRADE: A","

"Ratatouille","AK-kimkatt","6 July 2007","This is a great film. Pixar has done it again, in a silly, serious, very fun way. The animation is top-notch. I agree with other posters that the scenery is extremely well done. The colors are magnificent, especially the sunsets in Paris. Makes you want to move there right now. There are several laugh-out-loud moments, and even a couple that brought a tear to my eye. However, I'm glad I pre-screened it before I brought my four-year-old. There are some scenes that are too intense for her to handle on the big screen. I will definitely purchase the DVD, but will not be bringing her to the theatre. Oh, and that cartoon before the movie was gut-busting. What fun!","

"Ratatouille","manhattanmoviemaniac","16 July 2007","Pixar (The Toy Story people, for you cave dwellers out there) has scored another animation hit with this uneven, but still enjoyable feature about a rat who dreams of becoming a chef. Well, safe to say that we have an original idea there. The animation is, of course, superb, regardless of whether we are watching a surging storm drain, precise human hand dexterity or the Paris cityscape. There are several sub-plots going on and a little more focus would have been of some help here. There are also several overly long scenes of rats scurrying away from dangers that get a little wearisome, but a fairly charming story does emerge soon enough. This movie surprised me with a funny, little, seven-minute short feature, called Lifted, which was about an inept alien screwing up an apparent human abduction test. This was a nice start and lead up to the main feature, in which Patton Oswalt reads the part of Remi, a very bright rat, who is also gifted with a very powerful sense of smell. This prevents him from enjoying the usual rat fare of, well, mainly garbage. Remi, who also knows how to read (this really is one talented rat!), learns about cooking from the book of the late, great, French Chef Gusteau. After escaping a shotgun swinging senior, as well as other dangers, Remi finds himself teaming up with a lowly, clean-up guy, Linguini (read by Lou Romano). With Remi's talent and Linguini's more acceptable kitchen presence, the two soon form a team that takes the French restaurant team by storm. Linguini finds love, while Remi finds a perfect soup, but there are complications aplenty, including evil Head Chef Skinner (well read by Ian Holm), who has an interest in seeing the young boy fail. Peter O'Toole, as well, does a great job reading the small, but important part of the feared restaurant critic, Anton Ego. The story, which takes a little time to get rolling, is quite warm and enjoyable, is capped off with, of course, a nice feel-good finish. Well, if nothing else, this film could be used as a recruiting tool for culinary school, but that shouldn't be necessary, since, besides glorifying the art of cooking, it should be enjoyed by all ages. I found issue with a very brief scene that showed a gun being used in anger in a domestic setting (besides our Shotgun Sally senior mentioned above). I found this scene to be completely out of place and inappropriate. I don't understand why it was included. Ratatouille also has few less giggles than I hope to see in a feature of this type, but does serve up a very heart-warming story with a tiny, side dish scene about critics (like me), who create nothing and only attack those who do create. On behalf of critics everywhere, I take issue with this completely unfair assessment of the critic's place in society! Let me just make a few points in our defense. First of all, I'd like to say....ummmwell; I guess I don't have any points to raise. It's pretty much true. (This ManhattanMovieManiac work was first featured on realmoviereview)","

"Ratatouille","tubby1","27 October 2008","Ratatouille fails to deliver the Pixar experience that we so know and love. The animation is perfect, which is now expected, but the narrative lacks wit, passion and drive and left an expectant reviewer underwhelmed.Many of the characters in Ratatouille are peripheral to the plot and here lies the problem. The story is rather linear it does not twist or turn, it is happy to focus on Remy's escapades. The characters that do have a firmer foothold within the story are not entertaining or fun... There is no endearment.By far the best character has to be Anton Ego voiced wonderfully by Peter O'Toole - an egotistical, self-assured food critic... And that is what is missing from Ratatouille the quirkiness of character so evident in previous Pixar animations.Ratatouille is an improvement on the just sufferable Cars but apart from the last fifteen-minutes of the film and some funny moments, which there were not nearly enough, it was a rather sombre and just about satisfactory affair.","

"Ratatouille","samseescinema","13 June 2007","Ratatouille reviewed by Samuel OsbornLast year, when penning out the review for Pixar's last film, Cars, I wrote, ""Let's decide that this can be Pixar's single use of the Get Out of Jail Free card. Now they're back to square one."" I finished with a suggestion for ""Pixar to go sit in the corner where it can hide beneath its dunce cap."" Well Pixar can come out now, because it has redeemed itself with Ratatouille. Pixar's return path to the throne is led by the likes of a sewer rat named Remy (Patton Oswalt). Remy has a taste for the finer things in life, shunning the scavenged garbage horded by his father and the rat colony. He steals away to the kitchen and the French chef, Gusteau's, cookbook, ""Anyone Can Cook"", whenever possible, sleuthing gourmet cooking in secret. This, however, leads to the rightful owner of the borrowed kitchen discovering Remy red-handed with the cooking utensils. Havoc is wreaked and suddenly a rifle appears, ousting Remy and his rat colony from their country living for good. But in the chaos of evacuation, Remy is separated from his family and marooned off to the city of Paris, popping out of the sewer to arrive at the very restaurant of his most admired chef, Gusteau. Here the tales of Remy the rat and Linguini the garbage boy (Lou Romano) intertwine. On Linguini's first day at Gusteau's, he collides with the soup pot, sloshing half of it to the ground. Before any of the chefs notice, he starts refilling the pot with any and every ingredient within reach. Admiring the kitchen from his minute, mouse-sized hiding place, Remy witnesses Linguni's frankensoup. He maneuvers to the scene by means of acrobatic rodent scurrying and puts his culinary instincts to work. It isn't long before Linguini notices, watching as Remy dices at vegetables and tears at the herbs, sprinkling them with zeal into the now delicious soup. An idea is hatched between the two after the night is through. If Remy could somehow cook for Linguini in secret, then Remy could play out his dream of becoming a gourmet chef and Linguini could hold his job. Of course, as when Mr. Incredible attempted to relive the superhero glory days in secret, hiding a sewer rat in the confines of a gourmet kitchen is no easy task. Though Mr. Incredible was dealing with much more weighty circumstances for an animated film, which is the limb found lacking in Ratatouille. The Incredibles, the animated benchmark in mastery and Writer/Director Brad Bird's first attempt with Pixar, handled more solemn themes than the chasing of one's dreams. Its characters juggled middle-aged crises and marital boredom. They felt trapped by a beaming postcard family. Such themes appeared in Little Children, where adultery and sexual catharsis reigned king. But Mr. Bird managed to channel such discontent into a whirling, comic book world of superheroes. The colors, adorable animation, and Oscar-winning sound jostled the little audiences into soaring contentment, while the adults were offered an honest, smart story to sink into. Ratatouille isn't lacking in either of these categories, as the animation is as adorable as ever, the sound as bombastically rousing as before, and the story clever and humble. But it's the maturity of its themes that's absent. This isn't a middle-aged crisis; this is a rat playing puppeteer to a freckled teenage chef. But disappointment over Ratatouille not surpassing the likes of the best in animated film-making is hardly a criticism at all. It very nearly is a compliment. Mr. Bird has proved that he has a supreme knack for finding the animated in the droll. Ratatouille could very easily be filmed using live-action counterparts. Think Garfield in the kitchenick. But by dreaming up the entire affair through the computed neurons of CGI animation, a liveliness is achieved that would otherwise be ignored. Mr. Bird has made rats adorable and French cuisine not annoyingly pretentious. Such feats are magnanimous. And along the way he managed to tell a warm tale of friendship, romance (not between the rat and the boy, mind you), and the joy of cooking. -Samuel Osborn","

"Ratatouille","cadfile","9 July 2007","I had a decision to make. I had time to see one movie on Sunday. Either Ratatouille or Transformers. I was never a fan of the Transformers show when I was a kid. So I read various reviews on the two movies on non-IMDb websites to get a gist of both films. Unlike IMDb, both films were getting positive but not great reviews over all. Ratatouille had far more positive reviews than Transformers so I picked Ratatouille.Simply put, Ratatouille is just average at best. The animation was nothing spectacular. I guess the novelty of Computer animation is wearing off. It was pretty close it not the same as the old style cell animation.No matter what tricks or special effects a film uses, it doesn't mean anything unless the story is good. The story in Ratatouille was just average. It was cute in spots but tedious in other places. A lot of the supporting characters were played up only to be discarded quickly and the main villain had no setup at all. You only knew he was the bad guy because he had the standard bad guy sinister look - that was it.An animated feature film should have some truths inside it. It should touch on the real world with real emotions and Ratatouille missed it in a big way. Rats around food is just gross, even cartoon rats, especially if the animators spent months or years to get the look ""just right"". Maybe if it was dog trying to cook but a rat was just wrong.The best animated features are those that contain at least a nod to the adults in the audience who brought their children to the show. Remember in The Incredibles, the superhero family had real family issues to deal with. You could turn to an adult sitting next to you and say ""Ain't that the truth"" or there could be the inclusion of jokes that kids find funny but adults really find funny because they were directed at them. Ratatouille had none of this. In fact the film wasn't that funny.Brad Bird get credit for at least taking a chance with the characters and the plot but the execution missed for me. I was very disappointed.","

"Ratatouille","kosmasp","27 January 2008","... another Pixar hit. And it tastes and looks like one too! Concerning the latter: We're used that Pixar movies look good (other animation studios can keep up with the looks), but it's the story, the characters and maybe a magic ingredient, that differentiates Pixar from other studios ...So maybe Cars wasn't really Pixars best movie (it really wasn't, although if that's the baddest they get, than they don't have to worry at all!), but they made up for that with this movie. While the low expectations (mine) for a movie involving a car were met, some people might have been more than surprised, that the ""rat""-story did work out! I can only recommend this very highly (doesn't matter if you're young or old, or even in-between), all you have to do is watch it ... unless you have a fear of rats and/or animated movies of course!","

"Ratatouille","Cliff729","21 June 2007","The biggest burden to having a reputation for excellence is having to meet or exceed the high level of expectation that comes with it. Consider Gusteau's, the Parisian restaurant in which most of Ratatouille takes place. Its eponymous chef delighted gourmands with his bill of fare, and his books and TV shows appealed to the common man. But Gusteau is now deceased, possibly from heartbreak over a less-than-stellar review from notorious food critic Anton Ego. And the new chef, Skinner, seems less interested in quality cuisine than in slapping Gusteau's image on boxes of processed/frozen/prepackaged food.The parallels to Pixar Studios, which made Ratatouille, are obvious. Having taken animated films to new technical and creative levels with the Toy Story movies, Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles, the studio often takes an undue amount of lumps when its films aren't excellent, but ""merely"" great, such as A Bug's Life or last year's Cars.So can Ratatouille's hero, Remy, bring both Gusteau's and Pixar back into everyone's good graces? An aspiring chef with grand ambitions and a connoisseur's sense of taste and smell, Remy believes wholly in Gusteau's mantra: ""Anyone can cook!"" He's also funny, expressive, and well-voiced by Patton Oswalt. But--and it's a big ""but""Remy's a rat. And rats may be almost as unwelcome on a movie screen as they are in a restaurant.Remy's shot at culinary fame hinges on his relationship with Linguini (Lou Romano), the restaurant's new garbage boy. The film purports that rats can understand human speech, but not vice versa (when rats ""talk,"" humans only hear rodent chitters). By hiding under Linguini's hat and pulling his hair, Remy can manipulate Linguini like a marionette to prepare scrumptious new cuisine. Before long, the restaurant appears to be on the road to recovery, but obstacles remainLinguini must keep Remy hidden from the other cooks, the health inspector and his boss, Skinner (Ian Holm), who has his own plans for the restaurant. Moreover, the discriminating food critic Ego (Peter O'Toole) is preparing to write a new reviewIt should come as no surprise that the Pixar team, headed by ""Incredibles"" screenwriter/director Brad Bird (from a story by former Pixarian Jan Pinkava) executes the movie's antics with their usual technical aplomb. The Paris locales are gorgeous, and the film's food looks good enough to eat. And to the filmmakers' credit, Remy and his ""colony"" of fellow rats, although considerably cuter than their real-life counterparts, remain pretty darn rat-likethey have pink tails and scraggly fur, they usually crawl (though Remy likes to walk erect to keep his cooking paws clean), and in scenes in which they swarm en masse, it's as creepy and disgusting as it is hilarious. (I wouldn't want to be the parent who has to explain to their child why a pet rat would be a bad idea.)However, some of Ratatouille's story elements may be too lofty for the juice-box set. When the film devotes large chunks of dialogue to wills and DNA testing, younger audience members are likely to get restless waiting for more slapstick. It's also a shame that most of the film's characters are, well, undercooked. Linguini is little more than a plot device, forced thru the motions by both Remy and the filmmakers with little personality of his own. Other than Oswalt, most of the film's voice talent (including Will Arnett, Janeane Garofalo, and Pixar stalwart John Ratzenberger) isn't given very much to do. O'Toole shines, however, as critic Anton Egoyou haven't lived until you've heard an eight-time Oscar nominee wring laughs from the word ""Boyardee.""Ratatouille may not reach the creative heights of Pixar's best films, but unlike other studios' second-tier animated films (e.g. Shark Tale or Open Season), a second-tier Pixar film is still well above-average for the genre. If your kids aren't put off by the culinary plot, and if you're not put off by relatively realistically-rendered rodents (sorry, couldn't resist), Ratatouille is well worth sampling.","

"Ratatouille","classicsoncall","21 October 2017","The first thing one has to do here is get beyond the idea of a rat becoming an accomplished French chef. Having spent my entire career in the food industry, and knowing that even one mouse dropping can fail a business's health and safety inspection, I had to cast a wary eye for this animated feature. But beyond the initial hesitation, the story turned out to be fairly creative, and I enjoyed all the clever animated sequences the artists came up with to make the story work. My best takeaway was how to tell if bread is fresh by it's 'symphony of crackle'. That didn't sound like a very technical term to me, but melodious enough to make me remember it the next time I'm in a bake shop. When Remy's creation brings food critic Anton Ego all the way back to his own Mom's home cooking, it served to make Remy the toast of Paris cuisine, proving that at least in the world of Pixar, anyone can cook.","

"Ratatouille","marissas75","9 July 2007","Those wildly creative folks at Pixar have done it again with ""Ratatouille,"" a funny and sophisticated movie about Remy, a rat with an unusually well-developed palate. After getting separated from his provincial (or should that be Provençal?) colony, Remy ends up in Paris, where he takes it upon himself to save the renowned Gusteau's Restaurant from a villainous owner, a fearsome food critic, and an inept busboy named Linguini, who mistakenly believes that he can cook. Remy and Linguini enter into a ""Cyrano""-type partnership, Remy providing the recipes and Linguini the human face, while dodging all those people who don't think a rat in the kitchen is so appetizing.Remy is cute and appealing, but also has a fully developed, human-like personality. You are never in doubt that Linguini is Remy's sidekick, and not the other way around. Also, thank goodness, the movie doesn't make Remy able to talk to humans, which would be far too twee. Remy can communicate only with his fellow ratsunfortunately, none of them understand his ambitions.Still, the story of ""Ratatouille"" doesn't seem quite as tight as in other Pixar movies like ""Finding Nemo"" or ""Toy Story."" Those movies had one central objective (get Nemo back home/get the toys back home) and culminated in a thrilling action sequence. ""Ratatouille"" has more, smaller conflicts, and plenty of action throughout, but it doesn't build in the same way. Also, ""Nemo"" and ""Toy Story"" are told entirely from the perspective of the toys or fish; ""Ratatouille"" switches between the rats' perspective and the humans', and the seams show a little.All of the action sequences look fantastic, though: my favorite is a chase scene alongside the Seine, which captures Paris in amazing detail. Indeed, the movie's backgrounds are jaw- droppingly photorealistic. Pixar is also getting better and better at animating humansthere is great physical comedy when Linguini gets drunk and when he has Remy running around inside his shirt. ""Ratatouille"" has a consistently great sense of humor, with puns, amusing character interactions, vocal performances, physical action, and throwaway visual gags all contributing. My favorite character voice comes from Peter O'Toole as food critic Anton Ego. Monsieur Ego also provides one of the best visual jokes, with his skull-shaped typewriter.What really distinguishes ""Ratatouille,"" though, is its larger theme. Remy is kind of a loner, and that's rare for the hero of a kids' movie. Usually, a loner exists in these types of movies only so he can learn the lesson ""You can't succeed without friends."" Though this applies to Remy as well (actually, he knows from the start that as a rat, he'll need special help to realize his dreams), the real message of ""Ratatouille"" is about uncompromisingly pursuing excellence and teaching others to appreciate itabout leading a community rather than simply belonging to it. Let's hope that Pixar, too, can continue to take the lead in upping the standards of computer animation.","

"Ratatouille","Zoopansick","10 March 2008","Spoilers...First it isn't funny, for adults or kids. I especially think kids would be bored watching this movie, it has a mundane setting and characters. I think it tries too hard to try and put adult humor in the film (and not succeeding) at the expense of leaving out stuff for kids. I would have been more forgiving if it was goofier and aimed at a younger audience, but as it stands. I can't help thinking how bored I was now as an adult watching it and how much more I would have been bored if I was watching it 15-20 years ago.The characters in the movie lack distinct personalities, especially the supporting cast. There is a scene in the movie where Collete is showing Linguini around the kitchen and tells him a little about all the other cooks. Beyond the 1 or 2 line oddly dark description of these characters there is nothing in the rest of the movie that makes them distinct. They are just the guys in the background and effectively are scenery instead of amusing or funny little characters. Much the same can be said about the rats who are just cartoon clichés who have very little to do.The aforementioned Collete is a totally unbelievable character who is just there to be the love interest. When she first converses with Linguini she kind of blows her lid and almost stabs him with butcher knives while delivering some out of place speech about how she is the only woman in the kitchen. Then like a day or 2 later Linguini out of no where confesses his love to her and she kisses him right back. How did that happen? Is there any build up or reason for either character to love the other. I'm especially mystified as to why Collete's character, given her personality would be attracted to the dim witted Linguini. If this weren't an animated movie this particular relationship would be critically torn to shreds. But because it's animated, check that computer animated it isn't given a second thought. This is the definition of HORRIBLE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. This is poor writing that operates only on the clichéd level that states there needs to be a smart independent female love interest for the generic often dumb male lead.However I wouldn't say this is the worst bit of characterization in the film. That award falls to Gousteau. The deceased yet omnipresent chef whose message of ""Everyone can cook"" not only inspires Patton Oswalts' rat character but also provides ""the meaning"" or message of the film. Too bad that Gousteau's death totally undermines the entire point of the movie(!!!) Gousteau is established early in the movie as a jovial chef who loved to cook and firmly believed that ""everyone can cook"" and to be great you have to take chances and be creative. So one day the obligatory villain food critic comes to his restaurant with the intention of writing a bad review (since it is clear he is a snob and hates the notion that ""anyone can do it""). Gousteau then DIES because the review was so bad and his restaurant goes from a 5 star to a 4 star. WHAT!?! That is totally contrary to the message of the film...which is provided by GOUSTEAU HIMSELF! Gousteau should be the LAST character in the movie to be negatively effected by a bad review. He shouldn't care if his restaurant is only 4 stars; throughout the entire film his philosophy of cooking and good natured message of ""anyone can do it"" is hammered home. On an interpritive level his death completely undermines the message of the film. His death suggests that it actually does matter what other people think of you and not everyone can cook. Furthermore it suggests that Gousteau himself doesn't even believe that and his motivations aren't just cooking because he loves it. Of course over the rest of the movie the complete opposite is said and shown through the development of the plot. The result is that Gousteau's death is merely a plot contrivance which has 2 purposes. First (of course) to set up the plot with Linguini going to the restaurant and second to introduce the critic as a villain. Oh, but then at the end the critic is so moved by the food that he gives the restaurant a great review. Once again a character is betrayed by Gousteau's death at the beginning of the film. Early in the movie it was established that the critic was determined to give the restaurant a bad review based upon the sole reason that he hated what Gousteau was preaching. Now all of the sudden he is affected by the actual quality of the food and is going to give the restaurant a good review? I guess no one has ever made great food that reminded him of his childhood before if that was all it took to make his character to an abrupt 180. Whatever. I can't say I didn't see that one coming, and like I said before it isn't the worst butchering of a character in this movie.So basically Ratatouille is a bunch of unfunny, bland, lethally hypocritical characters cooking and talking about cooking in a restaurant in France. Oh and it's boring. But because it's computer animated it gets not only a pass but is lauded for being great. IF any of these elements were in a live action movie they would be criticized. The plot which betrays severely several of the characters (Collete romance, the villainous critic's motives, and of course Gousteau dying), the predictable outcome in all regards, the lack of jokes for kids or adults are all forgiven/forgotten. If you do decide to watch it try to look at it with a critical eye and try to look beyond the impressive computer animation.","

"Ratatouille","Pavel-8","4 August 2007","""Ratatouille"" is the latest computer-animated release from Pixar, the company that has produced the best animated films over the last decade. The odd title is the name of vegetable stew and doubles as a pun on the main character, a rat named Remy.Remy is no ordinary rat though. He resides in France amidst a colony that lives as rats do, thriving on the garbage and remnants of others, Remy is the exception because he has a finely-honed sense of smell and loves cooking. Through a series of fortunate events, Remy finds himself in Paris at a fine restaurant, where he learns how to interact with a kitchen boy named Linguini to create magnificent meals. Things of course get complicated, as Remy attempts to balance his passion with his family, and Linguini must handle being a celebrity through no talent of his own, while dealing with a sinister restaurant critic.Like all of Pixar's work, ""Ratatouille"" looks phenomenal. The rats in particular look good, with fine detail paid to fur in various states. The humans are not the most hyper-realistic creations seen on screen, but neither are they intended to be. This is a cartoon, and the artists seem to know that, because most of the characters border on caricature. The slimy French chef is ridiculously short and sports a pencil-line mustache. The critic has long and angular features that scream evil. Even though the movie is made with the most modern of technology, it is a throwback to the classic days of Disney and Looney Tunes, when merely a glance at a character would explain everything about a character. The bad guys look bad; the good guys are goofy but likable, and the gray characters share attributes of both, leaving the viewer guessing for a while.One thing that separates ""Ratatouille"" from most of its Pixar brethren is the pervasive kinetic energy. Plenty of other movies, like Cars and The Incredibles, were drenched with action and movement, but it feels different here because the scope of the movie is centered on a rat. When you watch Remy race through a kitchen or up a building from close-up, it feels much wilder and more dangerous than watching a human make the same thirty-foot trek, which is appropriate since it is more hazardous for a rat to make that trip.The question about all Pixar movies is twofold: how well does it play with kids, and how well does it play with adults? I suspect that Ratatouille may not be as accessible to kids as most of the rest of the Pixar library, because many of the characters are rats. Rodents are not as marketable or over-the-top memorable as a giant furry blue monster or an innocent little clown fish. Nor is the story quite as simple as some others. But the pace is brisk enough, and the story is understandable enough, thanks in large part to the brilliant animation, that kids should still enjoy the movie. Adults should enjoy it too, with the fine images, clever humor, and various twists and turns of the story. On the whole, ""Ratatouille"" is not as memorable as ""Finding Nemo"" or either ""Toy Story"", but it is good enough to be tucked right behind them with ""Monster's Inc."" Bottom Line: 7 of 10 for the best family film of the summer. What the heck, call it 8 of 10.","

With a weird, topsy-turvy plot with good Pixar quality, this film is sure to delight! Even though the adventure and dare may overdo itself, the characters and theme thankfully do not. The theme is cooking and it will not be a surprise that you will want to eat/cook just after you have viewed this motion picture! Also like all Pixar films, this has good quality CGI, the water and Paris sequences are definitely something to admire. So even if you are becoming bored of CGI, this film WILL NOT make you even more bored! Remy is a rat in France with an unusual dream: to cook. He is originally starting out life testing food for rat poisoning, but of course he is becoming bored. When a crazy old woman chases him and his rat family (which is a huge number of rats) out of her home, Remy loses his way and ends up lost in the sewers. There, he resolves to follow his dream and finding the famous ""Gustseau's Restaurant"" and is determined to start cooking. Remy also meets the amateur chef Linguini...The only downside to this film is that the plot is a little anxious and hectic. Luckily, like medicine, the cute rats and goodies make it better! :-) Enjoy ""Ratatouille""! :-)","

"Ratatouille","paulclaassen","2 July 2018","Although the idea of rats preparing food in a restaurant is anything less than appealing, this was a delightful, entertaining movie! 'Ratatouille' is just bursting with flavor! Whisk together stunning animation, a fantastic plot, great characters, and blend in humor, drama, action and adventure and you have a recipe for success! I enjoyed every moment. This is one of my favorite animated films, actually.","

"Ratatouille","rcbbo","17 July 2007","Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, A Bug's Life, Toy Story 1 and 2.And now, Ratatouille. Considering that this movie came from Pixar, it was so earth shatteringly average that it made me want to cry.Remy (Patton Oswalt, King of Queens) is a rat with a love for cooking. It's his passion in life. Often choosing cooking over family. His dad (Brian Dennehy) and the rest of the rat colony, all think Remy needs to stop chasing a dream that will never come true. It's time wasted.After messing around in a local woman's kitchen, Remy gets busted and chased out of the house with a shotgun. Everyone else, in fear, heads for their little boats to float away in the sewer. Remy gets separated from his family, certain that he'll never see his family again. Hungry and alone, all Remy has is the book, Anyone Can Cook, of his all time favorite chef, Gusteau.In his delusional state, Remy receives advice from a shoulder angel version of the recently deceased Chef Gusteau and ends out making all the way to Gusteau's old restaurant in Paris.Remy befriends Linguini. A young garbage boy who is credited with making a delicious soup that was actually Remy's. Because Remy would never get a chance to cook, he and Linguini enter into a partnership, where Remy does the cooking through Linguini, and Linguini gets the credit.As the movie wears on, the two run into several problems. They find it difficult to keep this secret from the overly mean head chef, Skinner, a growing tension between the two begins when Linguini falls in love with another chef, and they are faced with the challenge of cooking something for the most respected and hard to please critic in France...Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole) Critics have raved this movie as the best film Pixar has ever made. Uh...no. This is probably their worst film ever made. Pixar has always churned out great family movies, and I've always adored the characters they create. No...not this time.None of the characters are terribly likable, and the laughs are very few, despite repeated attempts with gags about French people.It was OK. Nothing more, nothing less. It's original, as most Pixar stuff is, and so that helps it along, but it just wasn't that good compared to their other work. It was a semi-entertaining, unfunny family film.A generous 6/10","

"Ratatouille","AmbushBug26","22 July 2007","I can easily say that this was Pixars finest movie yet, it was filled with heart-warming moments and jokes perfect for any family.The movies beginning was timed just right and makes you fall in love with the character instantly All the Jokes in the movie are surprising and pop outta nowhere making you laugh out loud. The characters are cute and lovable and the voice actors who provide them are spot-on perfect. The movie is filled with moments that make you want to just jump into the television or theater screen and hug the characters and make them feel better.And the plot of the story while kind of ridiculous, is a perfect plot for a rat movie, and sends Flushed Away rolling down the toilet. Over all Ratatouille is a film that is well worth seeing and is probably one of the best pixar movies ever-made","

"Ratatouille","ElMaruecan82","13 April 2016","While in the past, an imposing belly was the sign of good wealth, today: the poorer, the fatter.Indeed, good and healthy taste, in our junk/frozen/industrialized-food consuming society, became a luxury. This might explain the success of cooking-related TV programs, the sight of an appetizing meal is as rewarding to our senses as if it was eaten. Some surrender to bad food, out of laziness, those who don't learn to cook and are rewarded by the certitude that they'll always eat well, in total respect to their tastes and their stomachs.But can anyone cook? The question is raised in Disney Pixar's animated movie ""Ratatouille"", released in 2007, and it's as serious and defining as a problem in a high school essay. Everything in the film subtly relates to that simple question. Is the required discipline and dedicated available to the common mortal? The film doesn't provide answers, it's too adult for that, it just gratifies us with two great characters and let us figure out for ourselves. Of course, the most important and fascinating one is that blue rat, Remy, whose dream is to become a chef. The title ""Ratatouille"" is very well chosen as it plays on the word 'rat' and an iconic French meal, it also contributes to one of the most original climactic moments for any film.Remy is a fascinating character, even by Pixar standards, contrarily to many usual leads, his goal isn't conditioned by a specific mission, limited to the film's time-frame. This is a rat with a highly developed sense of taste and smell that was first used in order to detect poison. But later, Rémy felt he had a gift, he could recognize good food and from that, could learn about cooking. His idol is Chef Gusteau, a French cook whose motto was ""anyone can cook"". Remy used to watch him on a TV belonging to the old lady (whose house served as a refuge to the rats' colony) until discovering the chef died a long ago because of a scathing critic from Anton Ego who was probably to food what Pauline Kael was to the movies. This is a rather dark moment in the film where it's impossible not to believe the chef committed suicide, this is no joke in France as previous chef Bernard Loiseau committed suicide after losing one star is the fear Michelin Guide, the book whose effects can either be beneficial or disastrous.But it's still a Disney film and not to discomfort young viewers, Gusteau is resurrected in Remy's imagination. After escaping from the old lady's gunshots, his family vanishes in the sewer while he floats on the cooking book and maybe hallucinating out of hunger, discusses with the illustrated Gusteau (who's like 'Ghosto' all through the film). Remy wonders if anyone can cook as the chef pretends. But he actually gives another meaning to the question, it's not ""can anyone cook, even an amateur?"" but ""can anyone cook, even a rat?"" Remy will prove that, even as a rat, he can cook to perfection because he belongs to the category of gifted people who take cooking seriously. And he's immediately gotten the opportunity to prove his talent by fixing a soup almost spoiled by a new sous-chef hired in Gusteau's restaurant.Linguini is a lanky and awkward boy in his early twenties, he's hired by Gusteau's former sous-chef, a diminutive and sneaky-looking cook named Skinner. When he accidentally spills the soup and blindly drops ingredients in it, Remy manages to fix it, and the soup catches the attention of a prestigious critic. It's a matter of time before Linguini and Remy discover that they can communicate, and Remy becomes to Linguini what Cyrano was to Christian, a Ghost cook, so to speak, managing to guide his body in order to cook the perfect food. This is also a nice pretext to some of the film's best visual gags, the most explicit manifestations of slapstick and visual humor in a rather serious film. The smallness and fastness of Remy, the nonchalant and thin silhouette of Linguini creates great interaction, but it's the complicity between the two that drive the story.The second act allows us to discover that Linguini is Gusteau's unknown son and is likely to inherit the restaurant, which gives Skinner a status of clear antagonist. Meanwhile, a conventional romance develops between Linguini and Colette, the only female chef of the team (made of very interesting characters) and I think there was enough relationships in the film, Remy and his brother and father and even Linguini to really make us care for the romance. The crew was made of intriguing and interesting guys but their under-use didn't come as a surprise given how Rémy and Linguini formed a solid pair. Colette was a colorful and interesting character on her own but she didn't need to be in love with Linguini to help him. So, the film loses its track until a fantastic climax whose merit is not to rely on the traditional confrontation of good vs. evil.Anton Ego, tastes a piece of 'ratatouille' and lives a wonderful Madeleine Proust episode. In a way, this Madeleine moment makes the film's point about cook, it's an emotional connection, we love food that reminds us of something. I'll never forget the first tiramisu I ate, the best and I couldn't find the same taste. Food is something that revives emotions, mostly positive, it can indeed draw a smile in your face, and this is the power of ""Ratatouille"", it's inspirational on countless levels.I can imagine a kid dreaming of being a cook thanks to ""Ratatouille"", which is a serious vocation-inspiring film, but supposing Gusteau was wrong and not anyone can cook, then I hope the film's beautiful story will inspired kids to dream of being capable to bring the same joy and happiness to people by doing something with as dedication, love and passion as Remy.","

"Ratatouille","muppet-show","25 July 2007","Ratatuille is movie about a rat, Remy, who has a passion for the finer culinary arts. Despite peer pressure from his (fairly large) family, Remy just cannot accept the fact that he, as a rat, is condemned to eat whatever garbage he can scurry up, and is utterly fascinated by the world of cookery. Fittingly his hero is France's foremost chef, Gusteau. After being chased off their farm home, Remy is separated from his family and ends up in Paris, where Gusteau owns his restaurant (""Gusteau's"", amazingly). There, Remy sets up base and eventually befriends a lowly kitchen hand, named Linguini. Together, they set out to change the face of ""Gusteau's"" for ever.The basic premise of the movie is quite simple. Essentially it states that you can succeed, providing you have the talent and the tenacity to stick by your dream. When I went to see Ratatuille, I went in high hopes. Brad Bird, with ""The Incredibles"" under his belt, sets the bar high in his second computer animated movie, and he delivers the goods bar-none. Frankly it is among the best animated movies ever to come from the US. The story is very charming and heartwarming. And while the film is very funny, it uses a variety of comedic elements ranging from subtle humor to outright slapstick, there is an element of drama and tension ensuring that viewers of all ages will be kept entertained. The dialog is witty and absorbing, the story will provide some twists and the animation is beautifully executed. Even the supporting ""cast"" are lovingly portrayed (I especially liked the chef who once ""killed a man with his thumb"") adding to the dept of the narrative. The voice acting is done very well in general. O'Toole, portraying the menacing food critic Anton Ego, and Ian Holm as Skinner, the choleric Head Chef, provide for the icing on the cake.This film, very much like the ""Incredibles"", is not specifically aimed at young viewers. It provides a mature tone adding to the movie's credibility, which is good, since it will keep parents from falling asleep while their kids are having a good time. Actually, falling asleep will be the last thing on the viewer's mind as Bird again masterfully showcases a piece of cinema, in which the captivating story comes first, and the animation a distant second. Take your kids, take your spouse/girlfriend, take you neighbors, but go watch this film. And visit a nice restaurant after that. Bon Appetit","

"Ratatouille","onepotato2","14 November 2007","...but goes to pieces.I appreciate that this was about a goal other than falling in love. The choice of a plot that introduces kids to a passion for food is fresh. The final development which portrays food as a gesture that invokes love & memory is very nice. The critics change of heart is poignant like the Grinch's. Storywise, I can't accommodate why Linguini, who can't wait for a moment to monkey with the boiling soup, has to know absolutely nothing about cooking for the whole film. The two ideas are incompatible. The fraud storyline is not engaging. The movie is about twice as long as I'd prefer, due to dual protags whose stories need to receive development & resolution, but the usual psychodrama of earning a parents respect (Remy / rat) and believing in oneself (Linguini / human) must be a tiresome saw for kids, and adults have seen it a thousand times. The climax in which a swarm of rats gets the run of the kitchen of a French restaurant is over the top (and frankly kinda gross). All of this goes down while revisiting two of Disneys most exhausted, irritating mainstays; A) protagonists regardless of race/nationality will appear to be Caucasian Americans, and B) villains will always be foreign & physically extreme. Adding insult to injury is that there is a token black character in the kitchen who doesn't have a single line of dialog.I'm not a big fan of Pixar's run of successful movies. Only Monsters Inc. did anything for me. I disliked Nemo in the extreme, and you couldn't lure me to go see Cars with a thousand dollar bill on fishing line. I also think the decision to drop flat animation was a mistake.","

I quickly forget that I was watching an animated film and found myself laughing with much of the other theater audience throughout the movie.My 14 yr old daughter and I found ourselves talking all the way home about how much we enjoyed it, each of us picking out one 'favorite scene' after another.If I had just read the plot and not seen the 9 minute trailer on TiVo, I undoubtedly would have missed one of the most enjoyable movies I have ever seen.

"Ratatouille","bob020787","7 July 2007","When I first heard about Pixar's Ratatouille, I thought it sounded incredibly lame, and that it would signal the beginning of Pixar's demise. Not only was I wrong, but in a big way. Ratatouille was not only one of the most entertaining movies I have seen this year, but it might possibly be the best film Pixar has ever made, and that is saying quite a lot given their previous offerings.For those of you who haven't heard of it, Ratatouille is the story of a rat named Remy who has a penchant for cooking. This poses a problem for Remy because if a rat is seen anywhere near a kitchen it is attacked and killed. However, through a chance encounter, Remy teams up with an incompetent human chef to become the greatest chef in Paris.While the story might seem juvenile, director Brad Bird (The Incredibles) exceptionally creates a story which all audiences can enjoy. On one hand it is the tale of an outcast, who despite tremendous adversity is able to achieve great success. At the same time, it is a coming of age story; where the son must leave his family behind to do something truly great.This story never fails to entertain the audience, not only with its laughs, but also with its characters. These characters are voiced superbly by performers which were perfectly for their roles. Bird didn't pick his actors to have names to put on a poster (as Pixar has done before with Tim Allen, Tom Hanks, John Goodman, and Billy Crystal) but the actors were specifically selected for the characters they played.Standing out amongst these actors was Peter O'Toole who played the evil food critic Anton Ego. O'Toole delivers the finest lines of the film, as well as the climactic monologue in which his character critiques the food of Remy. This monologue may stand as one of the best ever, and it was spoken to perfection by Mr. O'Toole.Not only does the film have a wonderful story, but its animation is as delectable as the food that Remy creates. The world which Remy lives in was complete to the slightest detail, making earlier Pixar films such as Toy Story and Monsters, Inc. look amateur. Every scene in the film was visually stunning, a fact which made the film considerably more entertaining.Overall, I give Ratatouille 10/10 salty stix. In a summer that has been oversaturated with disappointing sequels to some of my favorite movies, Pixar has again created one of the most original, enjoyable films of the year, and I recommend it to everybody.Google SaltyStix for more film reviews","

"Ratatouille","freeds","5 October 2007","I will never look at the humble title dish the same way again. Beautifully artistic, non-cutesy animation, charming music and vocal characterizations, witty, snappy dialogue that is MUCH too sophisticated for children, TWO simultaneous success stories (1: true talent will out; 2: oaf makes good), a rocky-road-to-love story starring a very gutsy female, a terrifying but ultimately soft-hearted food critic, a cultured arch-villain, the mad competition for restaurant star ratings, overcoming the barriers of inter-species mutual mistrust and — above all — a celebration of those greatest of human inventions: good food and wine. What more could one ask? (A film of deeper social significance, perhaps, which explains my 9 instead of 10 rat-ing.) If you don't love this film you probably are dead.One thing I haven't figured out: why did the rats come in two colors, brown and bluish-gray? Will someone please explain the significance?OK, where's that zucchini . . .Barry Freed","

"Ratatouille","fuzzysham13","24 July 2007","I saw this movie with some reservations, I was like ""its a kids movie. I'm 19 yrs old"". But you know what, I was sorely mistaken. It's not just a kids movie.Pixar does an amazing job with this movie, it's up with the original Toy Story. The character are entertaining and easy to relate to. Everyone can relate to wanting to do something and having someone tell you that you can't do it; everyone can relate to just wanting that one shot. Ultimately that is all Remy and Linguini want. The characters are also well flawed, Remy's desire to be a great chef almost gets in the way of his family and friends. Linguini has to lie to protect Remy.This movie was more than I was expecting. A good story, well crafted characters, and comedy around every corner.","

"Ratatouille","CinemaClown","7 October 2013","Envisioned, cooked, garnished & served by the finest talents working at Pixar Animation Studios, Ratatouille is a magical blend of imagination, creativity & craftsmanship that puts together its fresh ingredients with remarkable care & attention to detail, is flavoured with fine dose of wit & huge shot of inspiration which is then baked to near-perfection under its impeccable direction, deftly written screenplay & incredible set of rich characters, followed by its garnishing with state-of-the-art animation, expert use of colour palettes & enchanting score, and is finally presented to us customers in a perfectly refined fashion.Set in the locales of Paris, the story of Ratatouille concerns Remy; an ambitious rat who is gifted with a highly developed sense of taste n smell, is skilled in the art of cooking & wants to become a great chef one day. While his rodent appearance & human's aversion to rats already pose a fatal threat to his passion for cooking, new doors of possibilities are opened when a fateful event separates Remy from his family & takes him to the famous restaurant of his culinary hero where he tries to achieve his goal by forming an odd alliance with the restaurant's garbage boy which turns the culinary world upside down.Written, produced & directed by Brad Bird, Ratatouille marks yet another achievement for Pixar as this revolutionary studio continues to scale new heights with its flawless fusion of quality storytelling with breathtaking animation and of all the films they've dished out so far, this is my personal favourite. The precision with which each frame is rendered here speaks volumes about the extensive research that went into its production and whether it is the depiction of Parisian streets or French cuisines or culinary art or rodent lifestyle or passion n love for food, Ratatouille captures these tiniest of details with sublime delicacy.The 3D animation from Pixar has always been at the forefront of its genre & with this film, it further pushes that art form into new realms to raise the bar once again. The biggest proof that Pixar absolutely nailed it when it comes to capturing the essence of food & culinary art is present in the moments when we find ourselves salivating for what actually are animated cuisines. Add to that, the characters inhabiting this picture are very life-like & well-rounded with defined arcs plus its storyline risks failure by taking the road-less-travelled but once again manages to come out a winner in the end, just like every single Pixar film before it.While characters in almost all their films are brilliantly designed, wonderfully detailed & smoothly rendered on the screen, there is one more thing that plays a vital role behind its success but never really gets enough credit & that's the contribution of its voice-cast. Time n again, Pixar has come up with a fitting cast to voice its characters & with Ratatouille, the tradition continues for the French accent here is pretty much spot-on. And last but not the least, there's Michael Giacchino's beautiful, heartwarming & delightful score that turns this tale into an emotional roller-coaster ride with its wild, dynamic & adventurous tracks.On an overall scale, Ratatouille is a mouth-watering blend of action, adventure, ambition, art & awesomeness that continues Pixar's unbroken winning streak by hitting an eighth consecutive home-run for the studio and, with the help of its terrific direction, inventive screenplay, dazzling visuals, gorgeous animation, awe-inspiring camera-work, tight editing, exquisite use of humour & mesmerising score, effortlessly succeeds as one of the most enjoyable, entertaining & fulfilling films ever made. Inspiring, motivating & satiating on both visceral & emotional scale plus radiating its heartfelt warmth effectively from start to finish, this culinary classic is a finger-lickin' delicious cuisine that comes delightfully recommended.","

The graphics are wonderful, but that's not why you should see this movie. The dialogue is perfect and moving, yes, to the point of tearing up your eyes. It's clever and sweet. The critic in this film (voiced by Peter O'Toole, no less) is a wonderfully hysterical as the archetypal villain. All the characters will charm you and make you laugh and cry with them. It is VERY poetic, without being convoluted, too deep, or forgetting it's a family movie. Definitely the best I've seen from pixar or Disney in an extremely long time... probably since Aladdin. Anyway, go see this one quick.","

First, it was special and there were only a few. Now, a new one seems to come every week and the stories are all so similar. Ratatouille though, was very original. Who would think of a rat who loves to cook and decides to help a human who CAN'T cook? I love this movie. I didn't expect much, but I was far from disappointed.

"Ratatouille","springsunnywinter","15 October 2007","We can all see the hard work put into the film and looks quite expensive although not as expensive as its budget which is $150 million. But the film has an absolute poor story-line that is probably written by a 10 year old child and lacks a single decent joke. It was about 2 hours with not even a paragraph of story about a rat who is helping a chef to cook; if the story is supposed to be poor then they should have cut down the running length about 1 hour 20 minutes. The film was about 2 hours but it seemed about 4 hours and when it ended I sighed with relief and I thought that it would never end.Ratatouille is critically acclaimed and they said that it's smart which is absolutely wrong because you didn't even have to be of average intelligence to understand and come up with the plot. I just don't know why critics always have wrong opinions. I'm not a critic myself but I still told the fact.I liked Pixar ever since I've seen Toy Story. Their animation is wonderful and stories are always interesting. For the first time I'm disappointed and about 60% of the film was quite boring that I had a look around the cinema hall and some children were asleep, adults were yawning and a couple of people just left and never came back. Basically everyone was dying by boredom. Pixar usually make their films suitable for all ages but Ratatouille isn't, it's too long for children and boring for adults.The Simpsons Movie was a million times better because it had a much more intelligent plot; every single scene was extremely funny, shorter running length and was made half the budget of Ratatouille. The only reason why I can say that it's a blockbuster because it's a Pixar movie and they really did a good job fooling everyone with the really interesting trailer. The top 5 best Pixar films are: 1) Monsters Inc 2) Finding Nemo 3) Cars 4) Toy Story 5) The Incredibles","

It is probably what I would have said before I saw this picture. However, Remy is such a cute little blue rat. I would never think of hurting him. However, in the kitchen of a restaurant maybe another story.You could tell I was no débutante. Anyhow, my review of this film. I love Pixar animation films. I think they are great. This was no exception. The film had an excellent story with some great themes. Determination, follow your dreams, anyone can cook,hope, friendship,being creative. Cooking is a type of art form. It is wondrous to watch as chefs put together these ingredients in such a way as to make something the is both pleasing to the eye as well as the pallet. Ratatouille is very pleasing to the eye. We are introduced to Remy, the young determined rat, as he is trying to combine ingredients in a farm house that he is soon roused out of (see the movie , I am not giving it away). After sometime in the sewers of Paris, he finds the place to be able to express himself. There is such heart to this film that it is one that I have enjoyed watching over and over. I saw it 5 times in the theater. I thought it was head and shoulders above the Simpson Movie. Great movie. Go see it","

One of the better Pixar films, no doubt about that!It really grows on you, for each viewing. The main character, Linguini, whose first name seems to not exist, is maybe a little over the top, but very likable anyway.Like a classic drama it contains villains, and heroes, but none is totally good, or totally bad. And the good guy wins, in a grand way!Nothing to dislike, except, maybe, a slight editing would have increased the pace a bit, like the rats's cooking scene, that uses the same sequence, twice! Noy a big issue, anyway!Sound, and voices, are perfect, in my book, as is lighting, and not least the animation, is just 100% perfect!","

"Ratatouille","baseballfanjm","30 June 2007","Ratatouille is the best animated film made in the US since Beauty and the Beast. Believe me, that's not a put down against American animation. Pixar has ensured that America has put out top class films for years now (ever since traditional Disney films have fallen in quality), and Ratatouille is the best one yet.It is the most mature Pixar film yet. No, not in terms of mature content (it's G-rated through and through) or in thematic elements (there's nothing here that will frighten or confuse the youngsters). Its maturity comes in the form of how Bird is willing to acknowledge that, yes, audiences appreciate smart films. This is a SMART movie. It presents a situation that a weaker filmmaker would exploit for cheap gags and obvious plot turns, and makes a hilarious, touching, and all around extraordinary film out of it. The writing and direction are top notch. The animation is the most gorgeous, some of it the most creative, that Pixar has turned out yet.Bird combines these elements into an absolutely wonderful film that is unconventional, beautiful, and just plain fun.Edit- Jackhorrorshow, please watch movies before casting any sort of judgment. You are very, very wrong about this movie's originality.","

Yes, you will see thousands of rats running wild, but these animated rats serve a far different purpose. These rats do not destroy mankind and eat people, and these rats are so benevolent. Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt), the gray, furry main character, is different from the rest of his clan, and is the most intellectual rodent of them all. Remy is so tired of scourging garbage, and wants to cook in a French restaurant after stealing legendary chef Auguste Gusteau's (voiced by Ray Romano)book, ""Anyone Can Cook"" in the home of an elderly woman that drove the rat pack away with a shotgun. His father (voiced by the ever-burly Brian Dennehy) does not approve of that, and wants him to accept the fact that he is a rodent unwanted in the human world. His brother Emile, the chubby, brown animal, approves of Remy's desires, but isn't nearly as picky as Remy is. Like the rest of the pack, Emile is only too happy to eat any garbage there is.Once Remy gets from the sewers to the restaurant, Gusteau's, he sees Gusteau's ghost, which gives him guidance on how to be a great chef. You see, Gusteau died of a broken heart after the evil food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole voicing it with pure gusto)took away one of the five stars. Ego's scathing reviews can put any restaurant out of business. At the restaurant, Remy hides under the hat of bumbling garbage boy turned chef Linguini (voiced by Lou Romano), and Linguini can only cook well if Remy is around to pull his curly, red hair or gnaw at him under his clothes. Also at the restaurant is Collete (voiced by Janeane Garofalo), the only female chef who is at first reluctant to reciprocate Linguini's romantic interest in her, but then they fall in love, and Skinner (voiced by Ian Holm), the venal head chef and owner of Gusteau's who wants to do away with Remy, his rat pack that invade the kitchen near the end of the film, Linguini's sloppiness, and market Gusteau's products as fast or frozen foods. And Pixar good luck charm John Ratzenberger, as always, brings comic relief to his characters, here as the mustachioed maitre d' Mustafa.As the movie goes on, messages abound. For instance, Ego remembers eating ratatouille as a little boy and decides to give it a good review and then lightens up his dark image. Note that Ego is definitely drawn darkly. But the real message of the movie is that when you are a lowly rat, you can rise to your status, go beyond it, and your clan can too.All the actors are in fine form for their voice parts. Oswalt is humorous and affecting as Remy. Garrett and Garofalo don perfect French accents for their characters. Dennehy gets into character as the tough father. Ratzenberger, as I said before, does his usual Pixar shtick. Holm brings menace to his role. But it is the reliable O'Toole who really enjoys the part as the dark, brooding critic, and does the best voice work of all, outdoing all the rats. Although this a G-rated movie, I would not recommend this to very young children. Skinner tells Linguini ""Welcome to Hell"" as he hires him at the restaurant. There is a lot of wine drinking, and in G-rated movies, alcohol, smoking, and the aforementioned cussing are not used in such movies. And small children may be frightened at the sight of swarms of rats and then dead rats in one sequence. I did admire the upbeat messages of this movie such as what it's like to be a critic or rat, and I am being a critic right now, fair, but not lenient or evil like Ego. However, the thousands of rats together can be a put-off for many. Still, a good film, and the best part of it was the restaurant and the drawings of the City of Lights, and you feel like you want to travel there and eat at Gusteau's.And hopefully in the near future there shall be a Gusteau's somewhere in Disneyworld, but don't count on rats cooking the meals.","

"Ratatouille","jfgibson73","9 January 2015","Seeing this movie years after its release, I had pretty high expectations. Not only is it a Pixar movie (by Brad Bird!), it seems to have a reputation as one of their very best. I was disappointed for several reasons. I thought it was weird to cast Patton and not give him a single humorous line, but that doesn't make the movie less enjoyable. Neither does the fact that it's not really for young children, although that is also strange since Pixar usually makes movies that all ages can enjoy. What bothered me is that I didn't care at all about the story or the characters. I really don't get why it is so revered. I also wish they had used the opportunity to animate more of Paris. Take a look at the opening scenes of Woody Allen's Midnight In Paris and you'll see what I was hoping for. You can't deny that it is a work of impeccable quality--the effort pours out of every frame--but I just wasn't into it. I will still give it a 7 because I appreciate the work that went into it, and I concede that just because it wasn't for me doesn't mean it wasn't great.","

"Ratatouille","ActOne","3 July 2007","The best comedies are not the funniest; the best songs are not the most melodic; the best actresses are not the prettiest.I bring this up because there seems to be a criticism that RATATOUILLE is not the funniest movie Pixar has put out. It does, however, have the biggest heart (not the ""aw"" factor like ""Isn't that cute?"", but in the truly moving moments that connect to something deep, deep down inside us all).For anyone to find a talent, a passion, and to be able to pursue it without having to hold back -- that is achievement at the highest, most godly manner, as if he or she has connected to God intimately because he or she has found his or her true calling and happily gives his or her life to it. We all dream of finding our purpose in life, and dedicating our lives completely to it...but it is rare that we do -- rare that we find it, rare that we pursue it, rare that we dedicate our lives to it. And for someone to be denied that chance -- not because of lack of talent or passion, but by being told ""you can't"" (for any reason) -- is among the saddest things in the world. It hardly makes life worth living. THIS is the real story of RATATOUILLE. (Confession: I am a 45 year-old guy who shed a couple of well-deserved tears at this film. I am a sucker for someone connecting completely to his or her life.)It is clear that Brad Bird lives for this message; THE INCREDIBLES touches on it equally well. His artistry indicates (to me) that he, too, has found his true calling. His life's mission seems to be to spread the Word.","

"Ratatouille","bsinc","27 June 2007","I'll be quite honest, I think this is definitely Mr Bird's weakest feature film so far, but that's not really saying much since ""Ratatouille"" is still pretty darn good (...plus I should also mention that ""The Iron Giant"" and ""The Incredibles"" are my favorite animated movies). Bird's great and very distinctive sense of humor is still here, but not in abundance like I was used to from his previous work, which is probably what I missed the most. ""Ratatouille"" is luckily faaar superior to last year's ""Cars"", it's got great visuals and truly incredible voice-overs, but it mysteriously failed to impress me. My best guess is that Mr Bird has so far managed to set the bar so high it simply wasn't possible to go anywhere but down. But not severely, I respect the man for trying different stuff every time, for finding mesmerizing and captivating stories and bringing them to the big screen, and for always having great sense for everything, be it random details, voice actors, character animation. I hope this movie positively surprises at the box office, so far the buzz has been kind of mixed, which is to be expected since last year's Pixar's weakest and dullest entry ""Cars"" failed to make an impression. In the long run I predict ""Ratatouille"" will be fondly remembered, adored by some, but mostly feeling just slightly sub-par compared to the Pixar ""greats"". But let's not forget how high their average is;) 7/10","

"Ratatouille","TwentyCalls","29 October 2007","Another incredible movie from Pixar and Disney. It's a moving story and I would like to classify such movie as fairy tale. If you put in too much logic and expect something close to real life, then you'll probably not enjoy it. As a fairy tale, the story has an amusing start, an intriguing middle and an happy ending. No excessive rib-ripping laughs here. The emotions of all the characters in the movie are nevertheless very human. Perhaps too many sad moments. Never childish; so may not appeal to the very young. My kids thoroughly enjoyed it, and so did my wife.Overall, I feel that it is the powerful story that makes this movie stands out among the rest. I rated ""Ratatouille"" a notch below ""The Incredibles"" because if asked which would I watch again, I'll pick the latter.","

"Ratatouille","timayd","17 June 2007","Very Minor Spoilers Ratatouille is the next film from acclaimed director Brad Bird, with The Iron Giant and another praised Pixar film already on his resume he clearly had a lot to live up to in Ratatouille. Like The Incredibles Bird came up with the story and then penned the screenplay, if the film failed it would be put squarely on Bird, after all the plot seems ludicrous a Rat who is a gourmet and an excellent chef, the film could have easily fallen on its face with a less competent director but Bird crafts it masterfully and it works wonderfully.Lets start with something that seems obvious the animation, its Pixar of course would it be anything less then perfection, and of course it is not. However it is hard to gauge just how good it is without seeing the movie. When it is raining (which oddly enough happens a lot) every hair on the rats will stand up and appear just like it should. Pixar obviously has an animated look in their animation, its not the eerily realistic animation of the Polar Express and soon Beowulf, you know at all times some one didn't go out and film a rat colony, but where Pixar really gets it is in the detail put into every shot so the viewer is looking up in awe at the screen. Which will happen in the pan outs on Paris itself with the lights and famous landmarks it is truly beautiful.Even though Ratatouille looks amazing even for a Pixar film that isn't enough the story has to be good and in this movie it certainly was. The story begins with of course Remy, who introduces himself dubiously as a rat with a highly defined Pallet, who is reduced to be the poison checker for the rat colony, through some misadventures they are forced to leave the house they currently inhabited and move to the big city. Remy eventually finds out he was not far away from his ""mentors"" resteraunt Gusteau's. When Remy see the garbage boy Linguini mess up the soup he feels the urge to fix it, which he does until he is caught and Linguini is forced to dispose of him, however Remy's soup is a hit and Linguini is given the praise, realizing he can not make it again he decides to keep Remy to help him cook. Throughout the rest of the movie they face different challenges with a crazy head chef and the frightening critic Anton Ego.The voice work in Ratatouille is also exceptional. When I pass by a Rat now, I'll probably expect to hear Patton Oswalt's voice, though maybe a little higher pitched. Lou Ramono who never has had a role this big (he was Dash's teacher in The Incredibles) is in fact incredible. Also have to give props to John Ratzenbeger to still have his trademark voice even with a french accent. Also I say give Peter O'Toole the Oscar for this, his voice is pitch perfect for the most feared critic in all of Paris Anton Ego.So where does this land in terms of Pixar, it is much better than last years disappointing entry in Cars and 1998's A Bug's Life. Narrowing it down from here however is much harder all of the rest are masterful films that all deserve awards, but I would put it past Nemo and Monster's Inc. and The Incredibles. With that only the original franchise is left the original Pixar and the sequel that managed to be just as good. It would be naive to proclaim Ratatouille the best Pixar ever while only seeing it once, so far now I'll make my favorite Pixar a three way tie.Before the Review ends however I must mention one last thing, with Pixar movies we always get a short film at the beginning. Some times there only OK (The Incredibles Boundin') and sometimes there better than the movie itself (Cars' One Man Band). Lifted is the one shown with Ratatouille and it is an excellent short film, probably my favorite though I have seen some of them in a while.A+Lifted:A","

"Ratatouille","illbebackreviews","2 January 2013","Ratatouille is one of the finest films I've seen. Its filled with imagination, passion, excitement, humor and great characters and a great story and at the end of the film, you want more! I have been a big fan of any good Pixar movie. I love Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc, WALL-E, The Incredibles and so on. In fact, the only two Pixar films I dislike, and I hate these, are Cars 1 and 2.This movie is just superbly put together. The film starts off extremely well and instantly, it shows us what kind of person Remmy wants to be but how the rest of his clan's influence, in particular his father, stops him from becoming a person he wants to be. He finds humans more warm hearted than the rest depict them and spends time reading through books of his favorite chef and learning to cook.I enjoyed this film's unique and childish idea of Remmy being able to control all the actions of Linguini, the garbage boy of the restaurant who is accidentally promoted to a chef.In this film, you really care for Remmy because of all the detail they give him. You also like Linguini and Colette and even find Skinner amusing. The voice acting for all these characters is just superb and the film takes unusual twists during the film. The animation in this film is unbelievable and it pays excruciating detail to everything. There are lots of moments to laugh at, particularly at the end but the story is so fascinating, that even without any laughs, this film would be an easy 10 for me!Must check film- Absolute Pixar masterpiece","

"Ratatouille","SteakSalad_101","28 July 2007","I entered the theater for ""Ratatouille"" hungry. Yeah, my stomach sort of was craving that buttery, salty, hydrogenated fatty taste of popcorn. But aside that--I was hungry for a fantastic animated film that has been absolutely raved upon by distinguished critics and average moviegoers alike. Hungry just like a food critic is about fine French cuisine.Mmm, and did I leave the theater full of what I wanted (not only the popcorn!) Quite bluntly, ""Ratatouille"" is one of the most original films I've seen in recent memory, and also one of the best movies so far of 2007.The film deals with a rat named Remey living in the French suburbs. Remey isn't any ordinary rat...unlike the tastes of garbage which his family and friends crave, Remey wants REAL food...human food, as he initially calls it. When he and his family are kicked out of this quaint town, Remey finds himself in Paris, with a new friend called Linguini, a human, who is the pimply-faced teenaged janitor for a highly regarded classy 5-star French restaurant.The problem is, Linguini wants to be a chef. And since Remey knows how to cook (and damn well) he teams with Linguini by hiding under his chef hat, controlling his actions (by pulling on his hair) to create the best food in Paris.Hilarity ensues. Truly, I expected nothing less from master filmmaker Brad Bird, who brought us The Incredibles, and some of the early days of The Simpsons. The directing is very well-done, the screenplay is superior, and the voice talent is absolutely BRILLIANT. Peter O'Toole plays the hungry, evil, most cynical food critic around and executes the role seamlessly (and painfully funny too, if you're familiar with his other work as I am!) Sometimes absolutely hysterical, sometimes the ""awwwh"" moment of feeling sorry for someone, sometimes downright absurd--like fine food, it's got something for everyone. I saw it with my little brother, who happens to be six years old, and the movie was silly enough to keep him entertained and sophisticated enough to keep me and my dad laughing throughout.Ratatouille is indeed worth all the hype it's collected in the month it's been released. See it on the big screen before it leaves theaters for good--and then you'll see this one at the Academy Awards!","

"Ratatouille","Jonny_Numb","8 July 2007","My reaction to ""Ratatouille,"" the latest from the seemingly endless siege of computer-animated features from Pixar or Dreamworks, is one of semi-exhaustion. Written and directed by Brad Bird, former ""Simpsons"" contributor and maverick behind 2005's ""The Incredibles,"" the film has the necessary ingredients for greatness, but comes off as a lukewarm dish overall. The positive message of this very kid-oriented feature? ""Anyone can cook!"" Which is what rodent Remy (Patton Oswalt) does best; after being separated from his colony, he winds up in France, helping a gawky clean-up boy at an upscale restaurant produce brilliant dishes, much to the head chef's chagrin. Strangely enough, ""Ratatouille"" has a monopoly on frenetic action, brilliant cinematography and editing, and a fine balance between authentic and cartoonish animation styles--yet none of this really makes the film 'funny.' I often found myself laughing at the sheer zaniness of what was happening on-screen rather than any of the scripted punchlines; even in a theater populated largely by children and their parents, the occasions of unison laughter were few and far between. Bird hit the mark much better with ""The Incredibles,"" which combined genuine thrills with satire and a sense of humor that pleased kids AND their parents. ""Ratatouille,"" with its cultural displacement (it takes place in France, after all) and focus on razzle-dazzle and lesson-learning, comes across as half-hearted effort.","

"Ratatouille","zetes","8 July 2007","Good, but not at the level that I expect from Pixar. It's always fun, but it's often in danger of feeling slight. Besides the awesome setpiece of Remy, the gourmand rat, entering Gusteau's kitchen for the first time and the wonderful climax, there is little that is memorable. The characters are also pretty generic, except for food critic Anton Ego, voiced by Peter O'Toole, and Colette, voiced by an unrecognizable Jeneane Gorofolo. Remy is dull, as are a lot of cartoon heroes (they're hardly ever the most memorable characters), and the other rats don't have enough screen time to make an impression. The villainous chef is a dull bad guy, and Luigi, the human who is helped by Remy, is never redeemed by the script. Even in the end, that character has taken advantage of Remy. He admits that to the other characters, but doesn't do much to make up for it. I would actually have ranked Disney's CGI film, Meet the Robinsons, above this, but the climax is so wonderful, and the aftermath so beautiful, that I ultimately felt very pleased, despite only being moderately so for the other 90 minutes.","

"Ratatouille","anaconda-40658","13 July 2015","Ratatouille (2007): Dir: Brad Bird, Jan Pinkava / Voices: Patton Oswalt, Lou Romano, Janeane Garofalo, Ian Holm, Brian Dennehy: Delightful and detailed computer animation about expression and devotion. Remy yearns to be a chef. Problem is that he is a rat with a taste for great food. He unites with Linguini where he performs through him in exchange for food. Of course, he is watched by a cynical chef, threatened by food critic Anton Ego, and perhaps even a visit from a health inspector. Directors Brad Bird Jan Pinkava collaborate and are given gorgeous Pixar presentation of France. Bird directed another Pixar film called The Incredibles as well as The Iron Giant. He is backed by the voice of Patton Oswalt as Remy whose passion for food makes it worth the risk. Whether it is ethical to deceive the public with regards of what is preparing their food, is up to the viewer. Lou Romano voices Linguini, a dish washer turned cook who is assisted by Remy. Janeane Garofalo as the female assigned to help Linguini is a complete cardboard romantic prop. Ian Holm voices the antagonist chef who conspires against Linguini. Brian Dennehy voices Remy's father whose old fashion traditions call for eating out of a trash can. Stunning animation that is often amusing and certainly recommended to kids. Simple plot with detailed structure that glorifies God's gift of food. Score: 6 / 10","

"Ratatouille","Mozz_Mendez","30 June 2007","I'm going to keep this short. Back in 1991 the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences broke new ground by nominating Disney's Beauty and the Beast for Best Picture of the year. Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite animated films of all time.Later to get around not having to nominate Animated movies in the Best Picture category; the academy drew up the Best Animated Picture Category. And that's great, because it allows them to spotlight the great Animated Pictures of the year.Still, just as movies that are nominated for Best Foreign Film are also eligible for Best Picture nominations; I see no reason that Ratatouille would not be running in both categories at next years awards.It's that good! No, I'm not going to say it's that good; I'm going to say it's better than that. It is the best movie I have seen this year, it may be the best movie I will see all year. It not only pulls at your heart strings and makes your eyes bulge out in absolute wonder. It also has one of the best crafted stories I have seen in a long time.Why does Hollywood always forget the importance of a great story and a well crafted screenplay? I think they do it on purpose, so when movies like this come out, you wonder ""So this is what good story telling is!"" The writing in this film is so good, I want to give it the Oscar, The Tony, The Pulitzer Prize and all other writing awards it is completely ineligible for, just because the movie is a reminder of what all movies could be, given the proper time to have the tightest story, and best screenplay possible.I'm definitely going to see it again, I'm going to tell everyone I know to go see, and honestly, I can't wait till the DVD comes out, and best of all... I can't wait till next winter, when I hear this name called out as a BEST PICTURE of the YEAR NOMINEE. There's no reason why this should not happen. It's practically written in the stars.","

The story of a rat aspiring to be a chef may not sound appealing at first, but the movie took me to places that I did not expect. I could identify with the need for family and relationships with the desire to pursue your dreams. It is unique in this summer of sequels - of couse, the movie has the trademark Pixar brand of unbelievable visuals and attention to detail..in this case, I paid particular attention to the restaurant's kitchen and its coterie of characters. The food depicted here looks so real I could touch the onions cooking in the oven at one point.If you have a kid who's looking for thrills and slapstick humor, check. If you're older and looking for something sophisticated, artistic yet funny, with oh so many moments of cinematic pleasure, check. If you love Paris, see it! If you're a FOODIE, make reservations at a fine restaurant for dinner...this movie leaves you hungry for more! Finally, Ratatouille has HEART, and I will go back to see it again and again.","

"Ratatouille","sullibrandon","1 July 2007","Ratatouille is a film that, with Pixar now at the helm of Disney's animation department, firmly and squarely places Disney right back at the peak of the animation business. It's is a sumptuous feast of cinematic delight that comes close to and may even be better than Finding Nemo.Remy is a young rat with a nose for good food and a mind for big dreams. He lives in the house of a grumpy old lady with a shotgun and spends his days daydreaming about delicious feasts and reaching that perfect pinnacle of good dish. A world-renowned French chef, Gusteau, is Remy's inspiration, and his book, Anyone Can Cook, is practically Remy's Bible. Remy's dad, however, isn't so fond of Remy's aspirations - in his mind, rats should stay in the garbage heap where they belong and not get picky about what they eat, so he uses Remy's talented nose to sort out the poisoned food from the safe food.Remy's passion is too great, though. His love for food knows no bounds, and he regularly sneaks off to try to cook. One day he screws up so badly that he and his family are forced to flee the old lady's house into the sewers, where Remy is separated from his family and discovers he's in one of the greatest cities for food in the world - Paris, and definitely the most beautiful CGI city that I've ever seen.From its first frame to its last, Ratatouille sparkles with a warm glow that is hands-down Pixar's best computer animation work. Everything about it is beautiful. They take a filthy creature like a rat and make it into this lovable little animal that will win you over instantly. The fur on Remy is also of astounding quality - if it weren't for his very human-like expressions it would look like a very believable rat. And it's not as if Pixar skimped on the rest of the rats while perfectly animating Remy. Every single one of Remy's colony is just as realistic as he is. The animation of the humans doesn't suffer either. Every single one of them, from the villainous Anton Ego to the hopeful chef Linguini is a perfect caricature, a brilliantly animated and creatively drawn masterpiece of character, life, and action.The story surrounding Remy and Linguini is simply inspirational. To see Remy dropping spices joyfully into soup, to see him happily sniffing his concoction to discover the perfect taste and smell is to watch Picasso paint a masterpiece, Beethoven compose a soothing piece of music, an Olympic gymnast land the perfect routine. Remy's refusal to settle for anything less than excellent is a testimony. ""Don't eat garbage!"" he yells at his brother. This isn't a movie about a rat cooking in a kitchen. This is a movie about one person following his dream and not settling for anything less than the best. And as much as it's not simply about a rat cooking, it is about food. The food in this movie and the way it was prepared and presented like the perfect dish - I was salivating throughout, even especially when Remy was cooking the foot. It all looked delicious and wonderful and perfectly good enough to eat.Yet another great thing about Ratatouille is its perfect pacing. At an hour and fifty minutes, one would think a cartoon would drag, but each scene is great and the film moves along at a nicely clipped pace, never pausing too long in once place and never cutting one scene too short. There wasn't once in this movie where I thought it dragged - from the very beginning I was sucked in and I wasn't released until the beautiful credits finished rolling. The gorgeous soundtrack perfectly suits the beautiful city of Paris and it's one of the best soundtracks I've heard in an animated film in a long while.The list of what makes this movie great just keeps going on and on. The voice acting in Cars was kind of unremarkable, and though the Incredibles was accomplished in every way and the voice acting was nothing bad, it wasn't particularly memorable. I questioned Patton Oswalt as the voice of Remy when I first heard about it. I don't particularly care of the comedian in real life, so I wondered how wise of a choice he was. But he perfectly conveys Remy's little passionate spunky self, wonderfully nuanced, great comedic timing, and absolutely believable. Brad Garrett did possibly the best voice work of his life - normally his voice is instantly recognizable, but he fit greatly into the role of Gusteau. Peter O'Toole was perfectly frightening, conniving, and evil in his role as the food critic.Another very clear strength of this movie is that it refuses to cater and stoop to traditional close-minded views that cartoons are just for kids. Even films like Shrek that adults are allowed to consider cool clearly pander to younger children - especially the last installment in the series. Ratatouille is for adults. It is not a movie that is meant for kids. This is not to say that kids will not get plenty out of it - there are bright colors, hilarious characters, and a funny story - any seven-year old will love it. But there is also plenty for adults to enjoy too. A lot of the humor is too subtle for the young ones to catch.I still don't know if Ratatouille beats Finding Nemo, I would need to see it again to decide, but it is most definitely close. It's undoubtedly the best movie so far this year, and the best animated film I've seen in a long while. A delicious and filling and wholesome feast of animated goodness and solid story combined with hilarious comedy and real characters, Ratatouille succeeds in every possible way and I wouldn't be surprised if it ended up being the greatest movie of 2007.","

It's cute, funny, and has amazing visuals of Paris along with other things. Ratatouille won best animation won best animated film back in 2007, and deserved it. Ratatouille is the story of Remi(Patton Oswalt), a rat that is smarter than most rats. It can detect poison, read, and cook. The rat clan don't appreciate him. They lose Remy one day and ends up being in the sewers of Paris. Remy is hallucinating Chef Gusteau(Brad Garret). Who leads him to his restaurant. Remy soon becomes friends with Linguini, who is a screw up who messed up a dish. Remy begins pulling him around and doing the cooking for him. Linguini's boss(Ian Holm) soon becomes suspicious and finds something out about Linguini. Something that he never expected to find out. Ratatouille is a delight for the eyes and ears. I left out some of the other voice talents in the film. Jeneanne Garfulo lends her voice as Collet, who is Linguini's love interest. Also, Will Arnett lends his voice as one of the cooks.

"Ratatouille","pere-25366","28 August 2016","One thing that Pixar has always done exceptionally well, and that has distinguished them as the preeminent animated storytellers (with the exception of maybe Disney and Studio Ghibli), is put the story and characters at the forefront of each of their films. One of the most fascinating legends out there is the ""Pixar Theory"", which is the belief of a ""shared universe"" in which all the Pixar characters, and their stories, reside in. One certainty is, however, that all Pixar films are connected by their true-to-life themes, exploring subject matter that will never manage to be obsolete and always manage to tug at those heart strings.When I first heard of ""Ratatouille"", I expected the usual, formulaic Pixar routine: A mismatched pair of partners embark on an adventurous journey. There will be a colourful ensemble of supporting players amidst the ""hidden world"" brought to life by everyday objects. But ""Ratatouille"" took the mismatch concept to refreshingly new heights. A rat is a virtual antithesis to humans and so we are enticed by the story to show us how similar these two characters are despite their inherent differences. ""Ratatouille"" is carried by great storytelling and characterization, fuelled by the instant conflict between our titular rodent, a bumbling kitchen boy and his impromptu ascension on the food chain (no pun intended). Remy (Patton Oswalt), is a Parisian rat whose dream is to be a grand chef in ""The City of Lights"". He has quite the sophisticated palate and appreciates the art of fine dining. One day he finds himself astray and arrives at one of Paris' finest restaurants. And this is where the real story begins. Could we genuinely buy into the idea that a boy can befriend and cook with a rat? Usually no but Pixar, and their exquisite weaving of such dreams, makes this feat imaginable. There is so much heart in this film and the usage of Paris as its backdrop adds a charming, exquisite touch to its telling. Remy's occasional musing gazes at the view of Paris invite us to similarly admire the visual allure Pixar has presented us with. The animation is simply superb – the dark, polluted areas where the rats reside almost feel like a separate world when entering the dazzling, colourful city-scape of the Parisian neighbourhoods. The painstaking details of the rat are also impressive, from the movements of its fur against the wind to the functioning of the rest of its body parts like its ears, nose and eyes.There is an undeniable realism felt throughout the film, largely achieved by the stellar voice acting present throughout. Patton Oswalt is someone I would not have pictured in the role as Remy but, after experiencing him, I could not have imagined anyone else capturing the pathos as well as he did. Same goes for Lou Romano, Janeane Garofalo, Brad Garrett, Ian Holm (and Peter O'Toole!). Overall, ""Ratatouille"" may serve up the conventional themes we have come to expect from Pixar, but it is able to deliver them with such depth and magic that I place it on a pedestal by itself as a cinematic masterpiece. ""Ratatouille"" is a dish best served to everyone!","

"Ratatouille","floyd-52","2 February 2008","I must have watched a different movie from the ""10 out of 10ers"". This movie is obnoxious, tedious, and ridiculous. The accents made it hard for kids to understand the characters. The shotgun blasts made it hard for me, a parent, to enjoy the supposed family-friendliness of this movie.Above all, the relentless over-acted character conflicts are sickening. Guys, if you can't make a kids movie without this level of conflict, you need to start making Rambo 6 (or is it 7?) The graphic animations are inconsistent -- the rats look rat-like while the people look like the result of Tim Burton stylizing a Dick Dastardly cartoon.Oh, we just lost one of the kids -- he found something better to do.So what on Earth is all the hype about on this one? Of course with under 500 comments, it is easy to imagine that most of the comments here are paid to be here.Avoid. Skip the rental even.","

"Ratatouille","bobbins494","11 October 2007","Disney did a great job capturing the feel of Paris, the animation is beautiful, and I loved the music. That being said...Disney has been beating us over the head with ""self realization/being true to oneself"" movies for years. The formula for this one is no different. The difference is many of Ratatouille's predecessor's have actually been entertaining. This wasn't.The protagonist in this movie is a rat named Remy. He's a gifted cook who grapples over following his cooking aspirations and being true to his little rat roots. He's likable enough, but neither interesting nor humorous. The human protagonist of the movie is named Linguini. He is, in a word, a moron. I disliked him in the beginning of the movie. I disliked him at the end of the movie. The physical comedy they try to pull-off in the kitchen sequences (when Remy first tries to control Linguini's movements), pay a nod to a physical comedy genius: Goofy. Unfortunately, Goofy is lovable. Linguini is not. The comedy fell flat.Before the middle of the movie I'm completely bored (and so are my kids). There's legality and DNA conversation, too much Linguini, not enough characters who are interesting.The middle of the movie is choppy and it's hard to follow the action. I lost all sense of time, with more than one time-passing sequence occurring. It seems the first 45 minutes of the movie is just filler, building up to something happening. -And believe me, after 45 minutes you're ready for something (ANYTHING) to happen.***There is one transcendent moment in this movie; the reason for the three stars I gave it. It's a wonderful scene that is poignant and full of truth: the scene where Ego (who is the most interesting character in this movie) first tastes the ratatouille. I laughed out loud, as did most of the adults in the audience. The irony was that none of the children in the audience got it...because they are children! They are currently IN CHILDHOOD! Odd that the only moment of humor in this dismal little movie was directed at the adults.*** In conclusion, the major themes of this movie are be true to yourself, even an incompetent loser can still succeed if he rides the coattails of those around him, and don't steal. Deception, using those you love for your own purposes, kidnapping, taking credit for others work...these things are OK; but DON'T STEAL.Disney needs to get it's marketing and creative department in order and on the same page. It is unclear what audience this movie was intended for: children or adults. It was way too uninteresting for children and way too childish for adults.","

The characters are all distinct and memorable and the plot makes sense.Unlike ""The Incredibles"" which was visually stunning but had very few good jokes in Ratatouille when the jokes appear they are very good and some of the visual gags are excellent.The romantic angle was always going to be predictable and clichéd to an adult watching this film and, unfortunately, there aren't enough jokes to compensate for this.The ending is a bit sappy which is to be expected in a children's film but the sappiness goes on too long, there is a big piece at the end which is maudlin and boring and a joke free zone.Although the visuals are great and the jokes are really funny there simply aren't enough jokes to make this a good film for an adult.","

It's totally amazing.I don't know exactly that some people could enjoy the meal even if they already knew that it's done by a mouse. I mean mice are the dirtiest animals of all. They carry diseases. That's why they restricted mice in the restaurant. The kitten is somewhere to make foods and foods need to be clean. So, it's kind of bad thing that mice are in the kitten. It's the worst that such mice are making food. Who will eat that? But luckily, there's someone.All in all, Ratatouille is something that is highly enjoyable because of it's fine animation quality and all. I totally love this animation very much. If I recommend an animation to watch, I'd recommend this one.","

"Ratatouille","claybo76","7 July 2008","A fairly likable film, but I feel that Ratatouille is undeserving of the high praise heaped upon it. Number 129 in the IMDb Top 250? Are you kidding me? Above Toy Story 2? Above Finding Nemo? Above The Incredibles (arguably the finest animated movie ever)? And, I'm not the world's biggest fan of it, but above The Lion King? The only area that Ratatouille is superior to any of the afore-mentioned films is the excellent, realistic animation and the innovative 'action' sequences. Character development? Minimal. Laugh-out-loud moments? Reserved for the last twenty minutes...the biggest redeeming feature of the film (well done Mr O'Toole). Silly plot twists? Check. Overkill of a premise? Check. Speaking English with newspapers in French? Check. Overdone physical 'comedy'? Check. Pointless violence? Check.I think a little more time needed to be spent on the script and not how well it was presented. I didn't feel much of a connection to any of the characters, and did not become emotionally involved with Remy until the end of the film. However, this isn't a BAD film, it's just disappointing. Brad Bird's Incredibles saga was a hugely engaging, entertaining and funny film, and this is not. I know a lot of people may disagree with me (129th??), but I felt this fell way short of the bar. Bring on The Incredibles 2 and let's give thanks that Hayao Miyazaki is still churning them out. At least Spirited Away is in a fitting place on the Top 250.","

"Ratatouille","Stampsfightclub","15 October 2008","Remy, an ambitious rat has always dreamed of making it as a top chef in France and after an accident, he winds up in the French Capital and helps nervous chef Linguini to create a name for himself.Pixar have become the biggest animated company in the world, joining forces with Disney just after the millennium and though the companies have had their differences, there can be no question that they can still make fine cinematic viewing, which is evident with this 2007 Oscar winning animation.The Incredibles director Brad Bird returns to Pixar and creates a wonderful sentimental story which takes a while to get into but leaves a smile on your face come the end.The beginning is intriguing with the camera freezing right on a rat that has just dived out of the window away from a human and simply narrates ""I should rethink my life a little"" this little sentence along with a few other well scripted words helps paint the picture of what being a rat is like, and soon the audience is engulfed into a life of hardship, about looking like pests and living in a world of survival.The plot is consistent but does take a while to get fully into as the characters are introduced slowly. Once the main ideology is set down about cooking and Linguini is introduced, does the plot pick up and we see a strong man and animal relationship develop which is highly likable and funny at times. Like other Pixar films the comedy is equally measured alongside a good plot and a heavy use of human emotions, for animals and humans.A side issue of animal cruelty is evident towards the end and has a great twist to the evil side of the world, creating hope for the characters.The comedy comes thick and fast during the middle of the film when Remy and Linguini meet and the sheer ideology of a rat cooking will provide plenty of giggles, if not as strong as Toy Story or Monsters Inc.Pixar's animation is the at it's very best here with the graphics mouth watering and just keeps getting better throughout the 111 running time.Ratatouille does rely on a few clichés but creates a wonderful atmosphere in doing so with good comedy and a feel good narrative which is healthy for the entire family.","

I've thought that after their greatest Finding Nemo, there was NO WAY they could even match that genius... but they did!! And it was spectacular! I had my eyes wet all over the film, not by nostalgia or whatever, but its brilliance amazed me so much I felt like in heaven... It was a feast to the eyes, those colors and those views were amazing, perfect, flawless... Best in animation ever seen, not even the colorful Pacific Reef in Finding Nemo could beat the elegance and perfection of Paris in Ratatouille. The characters, oh the characters! There were so many! But the difference with so many movies was the REALITY of them, I loved those to love, and hated those to hate! They were so multi-dimensional! The story, sooooo perfect! I must say, there are some films that are stressing with so much problems and conflicts with characters that last for the whole film, but in Ratatouille every problem was solved quickly so i enjoyed EVERY SINGLE MINUTE of it!!! The action was also incredible! I wanted to run along with Remy, very impressive. To finish, the conclusion was incredible! I can remember when the critic tells the chef to surprise him, I could see myself telling that to Disney Pixar, and they absolutely followed my wishes! They really really surprised me!! Thank you, another great film! Best film so far in 2007!","

"Ratatouille","AvidClimber","28 March 2013","Ratatouille is the kind of animated movie that mesmerizes you with its details, inventiveness, and story.The subject matter is simply a genius idea. Rats have been used before as animated characters, but never like this. Their world is unreal, but somehow, anchored in reality. The sheer amount of details each scenes has is mind blowing. The dialogs are strong and well thought out. The scenario impeccable and won't let you go once its starts. The voice acting is superb. All of it, pure Pixar.On an interesting note: apparently, they finally got the hang of animating wet fur, and seem pretty close on getting it for wet hair.The only negative thing I can find is that Skinner and Anton Ego are both designed a bit too strongly on the ""evil"" side, which is not a habit for Pixar. However, that's very minor, and they both fit very well in the decor.A must see.","

As a food lover, I can relate well to Remy and his search for food that explodes in your mouth with taste.Brad Bird and Jan Pinkava have created one of the funniest movies I have seen - and it stars a rat! How anyone can make a rat appealing is beyond me, but they have done it. The story flows as if it starred real humans, but the fact that it is animated makes it even more appealing.It has constant humor amidst the deviousness of the chef. Along with that, we get a very positive message about challenging ourselves to keep pushing the envelope.It is not just a cartoon for kiddies, but an enjoyable film for all ages. It should definitely have a sequel.","

I love how its a light hearted/romantic comedy which is animated and best of all, about food. The characters are all wonderful, Remy who is such an adorable, Linguine which i think is a fantastic name and Corlette which is such a cool character, actually i think all the chefs are really cool.I think the reference to Augsute Escoffier and Louis Bernard is also a really great thing to do, i think though it would have been better if they had the 3 stars like the Michelin guide instead of 5. Small complaints mind you. But wow the animation, i have to say i got hungry watching it, and i love all the reference to some really old school French food, and sweetbread is so cool to have a mentioning, i wonder how parents are gonna explain that one to the kids eh? :D Anyway, if you don't watch this, your gonna miss a great, great film, great job on pixar and everyone in the cast.

If you are looking for a movie for the whole family to watch, this is the movie you are looking for. Its heartwarming, and its a good laugh even for adults. The animation was outstanding, and the characters really come to life and touch your heart. After seeing this movie, you will think of rats and cooking in a whole new way. The voices were just wonderful! It was very very well casted, and Brad Bird was a fantastic director for this film. It was very pleasing, and absolutely brilliant story.

The problem is, of course, that no one will hire a rat to work in the kitchen of a restaurant. The obstacle is overcome one day by Remy hiding and passing on instructions to a human cook. The reviews for the food are tremendous and eventually the rodent becomes a big shot in the world of the animal kingdom. Pixar uses the technology as well as any studio today, and with an entertaining plot, it is easy to get caught up in Ratatouille's cartoon world.","

This is such a weird concept about a rat cooking by controlling a garbage boy, but I think it's brilliantly executed and has very deep messages about being yourself and not caring about what other say about you.The theme is amazing and the landscapes everything from the elegant Paris environment to the rough environment of the kitchen. The story is also very good because there is almost no filler scenes and all scenes make sense and are beautifully executed. All the characters are complex and very 3 dimensional everything down to the villain and the protagonist.If you haven't seen this, please watch this!!!","

"Ratatouille","Carycomic","10 July 2007","Patton Oswalt--whose appearance on the Jay Leno Show makes me think of him as a straight Nathan Lane--is perfectly cast as the voice of Remy. A rat who feels he is born to cook food, rather than steal it from human garbage cans. Of course, the only thing standing in his way is that old human stigma about rats being diseased vermin.Enter young Linguini, who later turns out to be the son of Remy's idol; the late, great master chef Auguste Gusteau (voiced brilliantly by Brad Garrett). Linguini wants to cook in the worst way...and that's initially how he does it! That is; until Remy learns how to control Linguini's actions by pulling on the latter's hair.Between the two of them, they manage to put Gusteau's Restaurant back on the five-star map. Despite the worst actions of the jealous Monsieur Skinner, who's been using Gusteau's name and likeness to sell the most horrible kinds of frozen food!Along the way, Remy reconciles with his traditionalist dad (voiced by the great veteran character actor Brian Dennehy). And, Linguini not only wins the heart of the lovely assistant chef Collette. He also impresses the aptly-named food critic, Anton Ego (voiced by the legendary--and lovably eccentric--Peter O'Toole).In short, this is more than an old-fashioned love story. It's also a charming fable about not letting others dissuade you from what you really want to do with the rest of your life. Not if you're truly serious about it, to begin with. And, I will be slightly disappointed if this doesn't become the sleeper family hit of the summer.P.S.---I can't help wondering if those New York City McDonald's rats got started this way?","

Linguini's boss Skinner knows something is up and sets out to expose him Skinner also exploits and commercializes Remy's late idol Auguste Gusteau buy selling many different products with Auguste's image on it.

The ending is very happy and it show rats in a good light something that almost never happens there's also a subplot of Remy's family's who don't think rats should be clean or coexist with humans. It is a great family movie that shows how it's not bad to be different and unlikely friendships can work out. This was originally not going to be a Disny movie it was going to be Pixer's first movie without Disny before the company's got back together.

As a critic, i always look out for flaws; as a movie-lover, i tend to be forgiving. In this case, there are hardly any flaws to speak of and so, nothing to forgive. Animated rats have always been cute, but the ones here are not only lovable but very realistically characterised as well. While this animated feature may have been made with the adult viewer in mind, there is more than enough of the fun factor thrown in so that the younger ones will find it appealing as well. At the same time, many life lessons were included as part of the story; thankfully, these were not imparted in a heavy-handed way.

"Ratatouille","RResende","11 September 2007","This is very good work. Pixar is by now a solid bet, and they have brilliant minds who are working their ways in new cinematic adventures. Here is another.The principle of the thing is a being (mouse) who is able to control another being (human) and thus create his art (gastronomy). This is announced before the beginning of the film with the short ""Lifted"", i commented on it and there placed my view on the subject.The way the story develops is fully Disney anchored, some bad people, lots of great beings, some trouble in the middle and a happy ending. We're used to it.The reason why this is adventurous is because of the movement and placement of the virtual camera. This is really well done. I suspect the reason why a mouse was chosen was because being such a small animal, which at the same time can move around easily, it was perfect for being climbing up shelves, going inside walls with rusty pipes, being on the floor looking up, being inside a cooker's hat (and there you get the transparency of that hat, another theme to work visually) and moving quickly between all those places. So they have that point of view, the one of the mouse, and layered on that, they shift constantly and go to the point of view of the humans around, other animals. This is very well paced, of course, and the editing is superb. The camera works as Welles might have done it, it understands virtual space, and explores it.This is much much better in these concerns than ""finding Nemo"" (which was sort of a disappointment to me) and i suspect i know why. There we had an immense space (the ocean) which we were free to explore. But that wasn't well done there probably because there were lacking physical references, objects that could stay still while the characters were moving around (great work exploring the possibilities of deep space is the one Besson does, while filming directly the ocean in Atlantis but also in practically the rest of his work).My evaluation: 4/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com","

The animation is top notch and visually incredible. I found very little in the way of any portions which might detract the story from it's intended audience, namely those who enjoy a good story. The great talent of Peter O'Toole is the voice of Anton Ego. a empirical food critic and the icing on this movie cake. Others like (Ian Holm) who is Skinner's voice, add impetus to the star, Lou Romano who plays Linguini. He's excellent by the way as are Brian Dennehy as Django and Peter Sohn who is Emile's voice. Two surprises to this film are James Remar (Ajax, from the Warriors) plays Larousse and Janeane Garofalo who is the voice of Colett, the heart-throb of our hero. The fast paced action and sympathetic storyline is enhanced by the musical score. In all the many talents who contributed to this magnificent tale are to be praised as the story becomes as favorably superb as the recipes themselves.

"Ratatouille","evanston_dad","9 July 2007","Wow. Number 51 on IMDb's top 250, huh? I thought ""Ratatouille"" was cute, but I didn't like it THAT much.Pixar's latest boasts beautiful animation, perhaps the most accomplished yet, but the film as a whole never reached the inspired and dizzy heights attained by ""The Incredibles,"" to my mind a small masterpiece. ""Ratatouille"" straddles an awkward and ambiguous line: a little too cartoony to be a completely adult film, but a little too sophisticated to be dismissed as a film for kids. It tells a warm and touching story about accepting differences and overcoming our preconceived prejudices, but I kept waiting for that unique brand of Pixar humour that never (or at least rarely) surfaced.The best thing about this film is Peter O'Toole, who plays Anton Ego, a fearsome food critic who delivers a beautiful soliloquy at the film's climax that encourages people to embrace things that are new while still retaining the ability to discriminate between things that are quality and things that are not. The soliloquy also happens to sound beautiful as delivered in O'Toole's mellifluous voice.In a food culture dominated by total crap like McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Taco Bell (among others) I appreciated ""Ratatouille""'s reminder that good, well-prepared food is a way to treat your body while so many people are poisoning theirs'. But I just didn't see the masterpiece here that so many others seem to.Grade: B+","

"Ratatouille","MOscarbradley","24 October 2007","I must confess that a movie about a rat who can cook, ('anybody can cook' is the film's motto), and becomes 'the greatest chef in all of France' didn't real seem my cup of red-eye but egged on by a five star review in Empire magazine together with my friend Nuno's assertion that this was the best film he'd seen this year kind of swayed me so I did something I rarely do if ever and dragged myself off to an early screening where I was the sole adult without kids. Oh, and on top of recommendations from Nuno and Empire there was always the fact that the writer and director was Brad (""The Incredibles"") Bird. 'If it's a Brad Bird film,' I said to myself, 'it must have something'.So a five star movie? Best film of the year? Well, not quite. I hate to sound churlish but the script's a bit on the thin side and it isn't that funny and from the silence of the little lambs in the audience is it not a mite too sophisticated for the younger tots? I know pirates may be dastardly and wizards can be scary but this is the 21st century and children have grown hardy, blood-thirsty even, in their quest for adventure so a movie about a Parisian rat with a penchant for haute-cuisine? I don't think so.Well, that's me being picky. As I pride myself on being a 'sophisticated' adult let's just say I loved it and am convinced that perhaps it wasn't the tots Mr Bird was aiming at. This is a clever, invigorating, 'grown-up' movie which might explain why I am prepared to criticize the script for being 'too thin' and for the paucity of humour; (I laughed but less than I had hoped to). It's good enough, (and the last quarter is very good indeed), for me to wish it had been better, (and at almost two hours it is a bit on the long side).Technically and visually it's a marvel. Bird is canny enough to adhere to the old-fashioned values of animation, (I like the way he constructs backgrounds that could be taken straight from the best Disney cartoons), while using all the techniques available to him to give the film a 'realistic' look. This is pop-art of a very high order but only adults will appreciate that.It starts well and it ends terrifically. There is a bit too much padding in the middle, perhaps, so I'm knocking a mark or two off for that but you still come out on a relative high and if you're a real movie buff you can't help but get a buzz out of Peter O'Toole's voicing of the food critic Anton Ego. This is Parma Ham cut thick, a master actor savouring the opportunity to have a bit of fun. I could have been doing with more of him. So Nuno, it's not the best film of the year but it's still a treat, nevertheless.","

"Ratatouille","neil-476","19 February 2009","I wonder what goes on in Brad Bird's head? How on earth do you come up with the notion of a rat who wants to be a chef and achieves his goal by just happening to find a young kitchen worker who can be physically controlled by judicious hair-pulling? As always with Pixar's films, it isn't the plot details which matter, nor is it the sumptuous visuals (a gloriously realised Paris, mostly seen from a rat's-eye point of view), it's the emotional journeys taken by the characters: Remy the rat flying in the face of expectations, Linguini the callow kitchen boy, acquiring maturity and self-confidence, Colette the woman in a man's world, softening as she warms to Linguinini's gentleness, Ego the critic, learning that there are more important things than that which he thought was so important.Every major character learns, develops, grows, and moves forwards, and they do so in a wonderfully visual way - and not only that, it's funny! No matter what my reservations about Brad Bird's brain, his mental weirdness makes good movies!","

"Ratatouille","kudos4kkms","3 July 2007","""In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face is that, in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But"" this movie is not junk in any sense of the word. This movie is a masterpiece, therefore I must rate it as such. Among the great movies of all time, I'm sure it does not rank at the top. I'm sure it doesn't change any political problems or some flaw in the ecosystem and I'm sure it isn't the more expensive movie on record. I know for a fact that it does not employ the most well known, sought after actors in the business and I know that it did not break any monumental box office ranking. But what it did do is this: it created a new perspective on Pixar and gave it new depth.As a member of the Pixar generation, I've enjoyed every Animated film by them and can remember the day the Toy Story came out. I remember the first time I saw that lamp hop across the blued screen and hop onto the PIXAR ""I"", and I can say honestly that I have enjoyed no Pixar film as much as I enjoyed this one. I feel as though every film made previously has just been leading up to the production of this masterpiece, or to put in the context of the movie each film was a tasty hors d'oeuvres that beautifully lead into this delicious entree.","

"Ratatouille","roedyg","18 October 2012","The animation is excellent especially the detailed and rapidly moving backgrounds. There is plenty of slapstick. They spend rather more time that I would like chasing the poor rat Remy all over the place with knives. The dialogue is a bit limp, similar to Ice Age, with only one in-joke for the adults that I noticed. Both the lead characters are supposed to be French, but have not a trace of a French accent. They both have aggressively American accents. I found this jarring. There is only occasional non-descript background music. Disney's best work in contrast puts singable music centre stage. The plot is somewhat predictable. Perhaps the most interesting thing is the way they manipulate the audience alternately to identify with the rats and feel disgust for them.","

"Ratatouille","meydiana-65242","26 October 2020","Remember how everyone was talking about Toy Story when it first came out? The incredible visuals, unique style, vividly imagined world? The next time people were talking that way with such enthusiasm about a computer animated movie was Finding Nemo. I'm excited to say that Ratatouille will be the next one to redefine the visual creativity and technical detail of computer animated movies. Honest to goodness, I was awestruck by the animation, and that never happens to me. It is a visual masterpiece of a movie if ever the term applies.The next thing to talk about is the ""genre"" of the movie. As Pixar enthusiasts will tell you, Brad Bird, the director of Ratatouille, also directed The Incredibles, which has the most inspired and creative action sequences from any of the Pixar movies. Ratatouille, while not so straightforward with its action, has almost as much as The Incredibles did, in unique ways. Most memorable is the shotgun scene near the beginning. (You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it). Other than that, this is the expected comedy-with-heart movie from Pixar that so many have grown to love.The voice acting? Spot on. Every voice is distinctive, and it never feels like a celebrity's voice tacked on to a character (Shrek, I'm looking at you), it feels like the characters themselves speaking. You can't ask for more from voice acting.And finally, the script and the story. The entire irony of the story -- a street rat with a passion for fine food -- is beautiful, and a tight, smart, wonderful script flows from this. The pacing of the story is odd and choppy at places, but this is a very forgivable grievance. The only other minor fault is that a few of the dramatic one-liners feel a bit forced. Other than that, this is the most layered, complex, and satisfying script from Pixar since The Incredibles.Overall, I recommend that everyone see this movie when it hits theaters (I was lucky enough to see a pre-release screening). Though not perfect, it is an animated masterpiece in true Pixar form with breathtaking animation and visual design.","

"Ratatouille","Chas_Wolf","15 June 2007","Okay, my employers keep a few pet rats in the office (caged of course). They're fairly cute (when they're not crawling over your food and stuff). Additionally, they subscribe to a newsletter for rat owners published by Debbie ""The Rat Lady"" Ducommun, one of the people Pixar consulted with to get a proper look for the rats.As such, Ratatouille was a company outing for us. Hey, free movie preview, food paid for by the boss. Pixar. What's not to like? I found the film hilarious. Yes, it's about rats in a kitchen (blech!), but the way they handled it was great (especially the scene where the rats are ""cleaning up"" in the kitchen).As to the storytelling itself, the film was good, but not great. It was a bit slow in some areas, then proceeded to jump around rapidly in others.This is likely because of editing and timing choices for the film.The film is still eminently watchable, it's just that in a few cases, the changes brought about by the story come up in a rather jarring way.","

"Ratatouille","DudeFromDetroit","17 July 2007","This Movie in my opinion, is the best movie Pixar has created to date. If not the best Animated movie ever, ONE of the best movies ever made. Now why do I make this statement? Is it childish at parts? Yes! Is it silly at times? yes! Is it a work of great movie making on just about all levels? YES! If you don't get ""IT"" then that's a shame. If you do then you will be entertained! Regardless where your from or background. The nuances of everything was really very intelligent and well put together If you don't laugh or find some kind of humor in this movie. You either have no sense of humor. OR...You have a giant stick up your butt! And your probably going into the theater wanting to hate it in the first place. If you don't find this film heartwarming then you must be a very sad person :( And if you can't find anything positive at all to take from this movie then your just a plain Ol' ""Hater"" as its said. Mr. EGO's (Peter Ol Toole) Narrative at the end was perfect that summed up exactly what I was thinking. And there was not one Over the top stereo type personality. But yet you definitely knew who was the antagonist and protagonist. Now this kind of story has been told before. The ""You can be more in life then what every one says your lot in it should be"" But I have to say it was told this time in a new and very clever way. A Rat chef! If you were a rat, How far removed would you be from that? Now If you hate the writing. You all know if most other writers that were going to make this film were just looking at how much money it could make. They Would have played it safe and It would have ended like this. (The guy would not have gotten the girl until the very end when he saves the restaurant that didn't get shut down. And the restaurant became a huge success) That's one of the things I liked about it. It didn't have THE PERFECT happy ending. There's nothing wrong with that though. But It did end happily. And there's nothing wrong with that either. I prefer a happy ending personally. But it showed you not all things turn out how you think they were going to. But then doe's anything every really do. Now I could go on about Ratatouille. OH I could go on about how much I liked this movie and why. But I think you get where I'm coming from. And one last thing the animation and directing were Fantastic. About ten Minutes in I stopped thinking about it being an animated movie. thoroughly delightful.","

I love 'Finding Nemo', 'Monster House', 'Happy Feet', 'Monster's Inc.', 'The Incredibles', and 'A Bugs Life', but 'Ratatouille' blows them out of the water. Ratatouille was amazing. It didn't lack in story. It didn't lack in comedy. It didn't lack in amazing animation, and it was ruthlessly cute. This is one of the movies that you go to for your children, but end up staying at for yourself. It was simply astounding. I think that all the voicing was great, with a little exception for Collette's accent, which wasn't quite up to par for me, but who cares? The rest of the movie is great enough to make you forget about anything like that. The satirizing of the French is simply hilarious. It is just a terrific movie, and I will definitely be seeing it again.","

"Ratatouille","dimplet","23 April 2012","This isn't a movie, it's a very long children's cartoon. It's more like a Warner Brothers cartoon than Disney. In a Warner Bros. cartoon, like Road Runner or Bugs Bunny, logic and laws of the physical world are thrown out the window, and anything can happen if it's convenient for the plot. They, like Ratatouille, are well-suited to the ADHD crowd, at least for five minutes or so. But 111 minutes? The biggest problem is I didn't really care about the characters. I don't think the producers did, either. Look at the credits: It's all about the them and the animators; the characters and their human voices don't show up for two and a half minutes. I have never, ever seen such an insult to actors in any movie credits!We're supposed to like this because it's got really slick CGI animation. Well, frankly, CGI doesn't work for me, at least to the extent I am thinking about it. All it does is make me feel that I am being manipulated artificially. Now, Charlotte's Web did work, and I really cared about Templeton the rat, but I stopped thinking about the CGI because I was drawn into the story. And Bambi still breaks my heart.I guess we're supposed to be really impressed by what CGI hath wrought, and maybe the current generation is. Most reviewers' frame of reference seems to be either Pixar or recent Disney animations. But there was very good animation before CGI, even back in the 1930s and 40s, especially Disney's Bambi, Snow White, and Pinocchio. There were some very well animated cartoons in the old days, before they started cutting corners and you got jerky, artificial looking motion on scrolling backgrounds; even The Simpson's isn't as well animated as many older cartoons. CGI doesn't make it better; it makes it cheaper. The reason this story didn't work is because it was founded on too much sleight of hand. The rat wants to be a cook, but has never made much of anything besides combining cheese and strawberries, or mushroom and cheese. Yet, poof! suddenly he's a genius master chef, the greatest in Paris.The kid shows up in one of the greatest restaurants in Paris and wants to cook, yet he has no experience and no talent. Even someone with qualifications is going to start washing pots and pans, as part of an apprenticeship. And we are supposed to be shocked that he starts as the ""trashboy""? Tant pis.So the rat, with no experience takes over for the kid with no talent, and suddenly 1 + 1 = 1 in a million.Now, I'm willing to suspend disbelief for a story about a rat who wants to be a chef, but the filmmaker is going to have to meet me halfway. Obviously, it's a fantasy, and apparently it's good enough to work for kids. But to work for adults you can't throw all plausibility of plot out the window, or it's just a bunch of cartoon characters running around on the screen. Or perhaps I should say caricatures. There is absolutely no depth to any of the characters, at least beyond the rat.Ratatouille was mildly entertaining, but the ending left me entirely unmoved; indeed, now that I think about it, none of it was emotionally moving. As I watched it, I kept asking myself how I would respond to it if these were human characters? And the answer was, without the slick CGI animation, there wasn't any beef. If I were to sum up the movie in two words it would be ""mostly boring."" CGI? Who cares?","

Remy the rat gets separated from his colony and ends up at restaurant Gusteau. Remy is no ordinary rat. He loves to cook and is excellent at it. A new employee there, Linguini, sees Remy added herbs to the soup and to his surprise and all the other cooks, it is very good. No one else notices Remy though, so Linguini gets all the credit. Only problem is Linguini really can't cook. The owner, Skinner, discovers that Linguini is really Gusteau's long lost son. That means Linguini could still inherit the restaurant. Customers begin asking for Linguini's special dishes, which are created by Remy. They strike up a partnership. Remy controls Linguini's arms with his hair. I know, that sounds really weird. Any way, its up to them to impress the harshest food critic of all and to find out about Linguini's father. Plus, Remy finds his family again, but can he leave the restaurant business behind for them.FINAL VERDICT: Very entertaining story with great animation. It had more substance than a lot of animated films.","

"Ratatouille","aharmas","12 November 2007","Who would have believed a rat could be so charming? When the studios try so hard to put together a hero, they seem to ignore that it's the actions and the heart of the character that they have to work on, not the exterior. I shudder when I think of those animated creations that animators have developed and passed as ""cute and interesting"". The hero in ""Ratatouille"" has been altered to make it likable, but he still looks like what it really is, and there is a moment, to the credit of the filmmakers when they acknowledge that the ""hero"" is still a rat, and that having too many of its relatives in a food establishment will have serious consequences.Still what lives at the heart of this movie, is the story of the underachiever who finds his way into a world that might not be very welcoming. The star of the movie is the food that must be prepared and used for different situations to move the plot forward; the rest is some very effective support by a clever screenplay that treats us and its character with respect and that shows much love for the fine things in life. It is a joy to see how someone appreciates the ecstatic enjoyment of gourmet food, the pleasures of preparing it, and the satisfaction of doing a good job. Is the clear presentation of opposite sides of nature: the mediocre and the sublime, and the unexpected approaches that provide us with much delight.The film is gorgeous to look, and it sings loud and clear, from beginning to end, as it shows the quest of its two main characters to prove themselves in a very hostile environment. It has its heart in the right place, and it shows how wonderful life can be no matter who you are and where you happen to be.","

"Ratatouille","98nurdinm-1","13 July 2008","Like all great artists, it was obvious that sooner or later Pixar would go through a bit of a rough patch when it came to their movies. From the giant first steps of ""Toy Story"" over a decade ago, each of the films kept getting better and better, each showing new improvements to the animation process and this, in turn, helped the films become much more than Disney's computer generated films. When Disney themselves try their hands on these type of animation it is obvious whose is the more superior: Pixar.But sadly Pixar have had a fall - not a giant, catastrophic fall, as their ""masters"" Disney, mind, but a fall none the less. ""Cars"" was, in my opinion, surprisingly sub-par, a 6/10 effort. I hoped that ""Ratatouille"", directed by Brad Bird, who created my favourite and I think best of all the Pixar films, ""The Incredibles"", could pull Pixar back out of this rut.Sadly, this film is only slightly better than its predecessor. Though there are obviously some very clever minds at work on this story, it still seems a lot like a kid's movie rather than a family movie. That's not to say it was particularly bad - I enjoyed it a lot. But I guess I was expecting something more original than the classic ""don't look at the book's cover"" morale.The visuals are great, as always, and there are some amazing characters in the film, particularly Anton Ego the food critic, played brilliantly by Peter O'Toole. Yet I was still left yearning for the scope of ""Finding Nemo"" or the originality of ""The Incredibles"" or the humour of ""Toy Story 2"". Good, but not great; a step in the right direction, though.7/10","

"Ratatouille","Imdbidia","8 February 2011","The story of a rat chef struggling to break into a French restaurant kitchen full of humans.The visual and technical creative brilliance of the film is indisputable, and, from that point of view, is one of the best Pixar movie to the date. Unfortunately, the virtuosity of the animation is not matched by a brilliant script.The script, despite being entertaining, can be complicate for kids and not engaging enough for adults. The pacific living between rats and humans is an utopia and nothing is going to change that, so the start is non-believable. Then, the fact that the rat controls the human is again impossible and therefore non-believable. That is so because for that to work the rats would be able to communicate with humans by word. However, that part is real, as rats do not speak human language. So there is a mix of real and unreal things that never mix well. Better do all fantasy or all veridical, not half half. In fact, the story lacks of the internal logic that Pixar uses to make believable their characters. The dialogs are OK, but there is not enough humor, there are archetypal characters and situations, and looks like a movie targeted to school- holidays children. Nevertheless, it is a very enjoyable entertaining movie, pure eye candy, but closer to Disney than to Pixar's spirit.","

Now i've learned to never judge a book by it's cover. I sat down in the theater, hoping to be paid a little extra to see this. I really despised this flick and that went away with the first scene.Ratatouille is the best, and i mean the BEST, animated movie to come out this year. Shrek 3 isn't even in the same class as this movie. Ratatouille is very enjoyable and keeps you watching the whole time. The rat was very interesting on its opinions on humans and how his clan though humans were. It was very interesting movie and Pixar even added in a little short before the movie begun, as they always do.Let me start with the bad. Let me say this is not a movie for LITTLE kids at all. I sat in the theater and about 15 children were crying the whole film, and not one laugh and most of them starred at me when I laughed at the stuff they didn't understand. This movie has a lot of scary scenes in it and a lot of sadness that your 5 thru 10 year old wouldn't be able to take. So i want to advise you not to take a child under the age of about 12, not because i dislike little children, just that you don't need the drama of your kid crying.SOME GOOD. The movie is for mostly adults as the jokes are not much as slapstick but merely adult actions and sayings. Young kids wouldn't apprehend half the funny stuff.In the end, Ratatouille made my day and I love it and i cant WAIT till it appears on DVD. Because this a dish you will want to eat again.","

This time, the experience is even more personal because Ratatouille happens in Paris, where we live! Even thought it is the 50s-style Paris, our feelings were here: if New-York is the city that never sleeps, Paris is the city that never changes!

"Ratatouille","H_Spengler","9 December 2008","I don't get it. After such awesome films like ""The Incredibles"", ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Monster's Inc."" you think you could trust on Pixar to put out top notch animation, engaging characters and a great story. I'm not sure what happened with this movie, because only 1/3 of that equation makes it....the animation.I'm not going to get too in depth with the story, which itself is pretty dull, because there's enough reviews that do that. Basically it's about a rat who can cook, and the human he uses as his puppet. There are plenty of characters in this movie, and yet you manage to care about none of them. Pixar, Disney, heck even Warner Brothers have proved time and time again that it's possible to make a movie involving animals (no matter which animals they were) that you care about, along with a compelling story that holds your attention throughout the entire thing. They failed massively on both fronts here.Enter Remy, the rat who can cook, but as you can imagine a rat cooking your food is disgusting, no matter how cute he may be. Linguini is an inept, dull, bumbling idiot and he never changes throughout the film. Colette is your stereotypical tough girl trying to prove something in a mans world. The rest of the kitchen staff are barely worth a mention as they serve as a dull backdrop and little else. The voice acting is OK, I really was surprised as to why they decided on Janeane Garafalo (who I LOVED until recent years when she's seemingly gone crazy (political, etc..) Why not just get a French actress? And what executive looked over the story board and said ""oh yeah...Janeane Garafalo."" People like Will Arnett and Brian Dennehy are wasted and nearly invisible as it could have been anyone voicing those very minor parts. John Ratzenberger of course surfaces as it is his custom to voice some character in every Pixar film. The ONLY interesting characters worth a mention are Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole) and Skinner (Ian Holm) as a ruthless well known food critic/head chef and owner of Gusteau's (respectively.) They seem to be the only actors putting any effort into the voice expression of their characters. (O'Toole as usual is excellent whether it be live action or animated.) Remy is cute. I'll give him that. Kids will like him, he's otherwise pretty boring. I'm sorry but the idea of rats in the kitchen no matter how cute is still unappealing to me. The small ghost of the deceased master chef Gusteau is just an odd addition, I never fully got why he was there other than to act as a sort of Jiminy the Cricket or ""shoulder angel"" to Remy and even then he didn't really do anything. In a nutshell, just a real BORING movie for both kids and adults. The animation is excellent, but I would expect nothing less from Pixar. But the story and characters are pretty much complete crap (except for O'Toole and Holm's characters.) My advice, just skip this one and cross your fingers that Pixar's next venture is vastly better.","

Yet, obviously, this is a rather tough dream for a rat. But opportunity knocks when a young boy, who desperately needs to keep his job at the restaurant, despite his lack of cooking abilities, discovers and partners the young Remy. Its up to the two of them to avoid the insane head chef, bring the rest of Remy's family up to his standards, win his partner a girl, and, of course, produce the finest Ratatouille in all of France.Last year's Pixar movie, ""Cars"", was really underwhelming, although still generic. This put Pixar back on its tracks. Not just with the seamless, not to mention wonderful, animation, imagination, but with the unique storyline.Every speck of scene is done with great detail (of course with a budget of $150 million!). The vivid colors and all turns this into a visual masterpiece! Yet, the movie (for a whole) wasn't perfect. It fell just beneath my expectations.Maybe I expected more than the unusual. Although with a weird plot, it didn't go anywhere in the movie until the last twenty minutes in the film, not to mention some choppy pacing. Also, this movie is more for adults and teens than for kids, probably why it didn't make as much money than most Pixar films.Still, in the end, Ratatouille is a fantastic animated feature, worthy in the Pixar franchise. It's funny and it's a visual delight. Although it doesn't make a perfect meal, it's still fantastic to eat.","

Every plate of food, every bottle of wine, every cooking utensil, every gesture is beautifully rendered; but not just to impress: the animation serves the story not the other way round and that is the real triumphAnd perhaps this is the point, here is originality with verve and élan, and at at the end of the day Ratatouille remains one of the best animated films of all time. It really is a treat for anyone who loves life.","

"Ratatouille","limaluisa5","16 September 2007","This is the type of film that makes adults feel thankful for the fact that they have to take their kids to the movies! I have watched the film with my three kids and when it was over, it was impossible to say who had enjoyed the film more. Apart from the technical aspects, which seem remarkable to me (although I'm no expert in the area), I found the plot and the characters absolutely delicious. They are funny, they are human, they have an enormous sense of humor. We don't have the typical animated story where animals and people speak the same language, but instead we see that different worlds, different languages can come together and find some sort of understanding. Besides they managed to make rats interesting, even attractive. I do hope more films like this one will come up!","

"Ratatouille","joesgirljeri","29 June 2007","I loved every minute of this film. The characters were real and endearing. The bad guys had real motivation and also provided a lot of comic relief. The main character goes on a great journey and you really feel for him the entire way. The movie is well-paced and doesn't seem to drag at any point. The voice talent was outstanding, the voices were very well suited to the characters with no overpowering ""star"" qualities. The animation is stunning, it takes your breath away at times. There were a few jokes for adults, lots of moments where everyone in the theater laughed and I didn't feel like there was any bathroom humor, which was nice.The movie was as beautiful as ""Nemo"" and as heartwarming as ""Toy Story"". I loved it. My three-year-old loved it. There was plenty of laughter and cheering in the audience as well. A great movie experience, don't miss it.","

"Ratatouille","Prismark10","11 December 2016","Ratatouille had a troubled history despite Brad Bird getting the screenwriter and director credit as well as taking the Best Oscar for Animation. The original director was (Czech born) British Oscar winning animator Jan Pinkava who only now gets a story co-credit for this this film. His vision apparently needed to be Pixar-fied.Yet underlying this movie is Pinkava's vision, when the story gets boring and predictable I see Hollywood at play as the film gets derivative, you know joining the dots from A-Z.Maybe the dirty smelly scavenging rats represent humans with Remy being the most well read and cultured example. Remy does not want to go through rubbish every night he wants to cook and is inspired after taking legendary chef, the late Auguste Gusteau's cookbook, 'Anyone Can Cook.'Remy rises from the sewers of Paris to Gusteau's restaurant where he sees Gusteau's ghost or is it a figment of the rat's imagination? The restaurant is now run by head chef Skinner who believes in the commercialisation of Gusteau's name.Remy hides under the hat of the incompetent, bumbling Linguini new to the kitchen and shows him how to cook by pulling his curly hair, fellow chef Collete teaches him the basic but it is Remy who provides the inspiration that wows the customers and arouses the interest of renowned and intimidating food critic Anton Ego who took one of the stars away from Gusteau. Skinner is also suspicious of Linguini's skills, in fact he smells a rat.This is a breezy film, with rats in the kitchen cooking the food rather than taking it away although we do see that as well. The love angle is boring and predictable as are the few obligatory chase scenes in the streets and river of Paris. Yet I could not help wondering how Pinkava's film would had turned out.","

"Ratatouille","billion_mucks","19 December 2007","""Ratatouille"" is Pixar's most intelligent, mature and delicate work of all it's way and experience. I had a laughing time with Nemo, I particularly didn't enjoy the Incredibles, but with Ratatouille Pixar reached new heights. Animation for adults, hidden in a package for kids.¿Why would you explain love scenes, a cook that was in jail, a cook that ran away from home, a cook that is a gambler? Because adults can enjoy its subtleties and innuendos as kids enjoy the plain and open jokes. Besides the beautiful, vivid voice work, there is an excellent approach to food as art, food as passion. We enjoy movies, some enjoy video games, Remy enjoys food as an art, passion and identity, with different smells, countries and tastes. But the fact that a rat, filthy creature, enjoys this, makes the movie an interesting tale.This karma of humanizing every little bit of what's inhuman gives a blatant irony: humans in the film are caricaturesque and are the less developed of all. The positivism of the film, the life they give to the characters is just one part of the story. Graphics excel in the movie: the fact that we want to taste that crumbly, hot bread or eat that elite Roquefort and cherries is impressive, going from the adjusted human expressions to the dynamic of the film, how people move and act.""Ratatouille"" is a nice, charming tale. With superior graphics and voices, and a nice message we can say that if Pixar continues this path, things are going to be very different in the Animation Industry and we adults can take our kids to the movies and be so excited like them as well.","

"Ratatouille","smickey","8 September 2007","The animation is simply impressive. As far as I can judge, no detail was left out. It was simply perfect. Even without comparing it to other animation movies I think one can agree that this one is for sure among the top ones. However, when it comes to the story, there is really nothing original about it. In its essence, there are so many similarities with ""The Perfume"", another superlative movie in my eyes. OK, Grenouille was really not a rat, maybe in the metaphoric sense he was, but still a nobody who created the most fine perfumes ever, just using his extraordinary well developed nose. Same as here. But at the end... who cares... Not everybody has seen ""The Perfume"" so this will leave him or her the freedom to enjoy without the feeling of deja vu. The movie is very entertaining and funny. It's a movie for the whole family and to some extent also educational, which is not always the case. For sure worth buying the DVD.","

And it is true every human being hates rats. Maybe it's wrong.This movie is totally fantasy but realistic at the same time. That is why so attractive.

"Ratatouille","emasterslake","9 July 2007","As long time fan of Pixar's works. I still consider it the best American CGI company ever. After seven big hits, the company is very worthy in the animation industry. With Ratatouille marking as their eighth film. I had a hunch it'll be something different.Set in a retro era of France. Remy the rat lives with his family of pack rats in the country side. Him and everyone else survive by eating garbage and waste. Remy had it with rats living in this kind of style. So he eats fresh food instead, which is nothing compared to the taste of everyday garbage. His father always told him to stay away from humans. Because rats are seen as thieves and unsanitary. Remy however wants to change that method. As he was inspired by a chef on TV named Gustav, who states that anyone can cook. So Remy begins to mix ingredients together to create dishes for his pack. Hoping that it'll change the way rat eat by cooking simple ingredients rather than steal food.One day however, after an unexpected accident. Remy finds himself in Paris, France. Where he stumbles upon Gustav's restaurant. Where he he'll cross paths with Linguini, a non-experienced employee, who ended up as a poor garbage boy. Remy however will change his life by helping him become an experienced chef. But can he change the image of rats for good? I have to say that this movie is more than great. The word great can't match the excellence of the film. Ratatouille stands out differently than the other Pixar films do. Directed by Brad Bird who's given us ""Iron Giant"" & ""The Incredibles"". Has created a unique CG animated movie. Unlike his previous titles, which were science fiction related. This one is more of a culinary/fictional story. But the style and look resembles both a Pixar and a Brad Bird film.Ignore all the negative reviews from those who don't know true art. Ratatouille is highly a highly recommended movie for all ages & all Pixar fans. The humor will make you laugh. The plot will be interesting to witness. And the characters will sheerly entertain you.I guaranteed it'll be the best CGI film of this year.","

"Ratatouille","letsmakeadeel","29 June 2007","What a fantastic movie. I haven't enjoyed an animated film like this in years. Perhaps animation these days has become more of measure of how real we can make things look with technology. We have forgotten what makes classics like Jungle Book, Lion King, Aladdin & Beauty and the Beast forever remain in our hearts and our memories. I have seen Finding Nemo & Toy Story, and though I can appreciate the trailblazing methods in creating animation that is unbelievably life-like and impressive, I have always felt that something was lacking. It's that feel-good, lesson-learned, awe-inspiring, tear-jerking story that we all want to share with others close to us. This isn't a semi-musical, as many of the classics were, but an equally well constructed soundtrack does the trick too. How about creativity? Most animated films these days make a parody of real life through the eyes of an ant, car, fish, or chicken - while throwing in the voices of a few currently popular celebrities for good measure. But not this film, the voices are done by those who really fit the role/character, and the daily life of a rat is not paralleled with our daily lives. It does not monopolize the story. I felt an absolute joy watching Ratatouille (what a title too) - the plot, the creativity, the animation and the soundtrack; all were on point. Pure genius. If given a chance, this one may just become a classic. Bravo!","

"Ratatouille","sakcee","8 July 2007","The movie is the most boring of all the pixar movies. I am not sure why it was necessary to over represent the french food and french snottiness. There was no story , There wasn't even any adventure or drama. It was just mundane and lame. I loved all the previous pixar movies. This one is a big let down. The chefs in the movie actually make fun of American food, burritos , hotdogs and even Asian food. I don't think that was necessary, all these choices makes America such a great place. and since when are food critics the biggest villains. I am not sure who is incharge at pixar for creative ideas for emphasizing the french. The small part of Edna in Incredible was fine. but this movie is kinda stretching it","

"Ratatouille","neil_fraser","7 July 2007","Out of all my reviews I have done for IMDb, this is the one review i'm most happy to be typing right now. If you are reading this, I can't tell you enough to go see this movie. It's that good. Easily one of the best, if not the best Pixar film to date. Animation is awesome, script is awesome, scenery is awesome. Not only that, but it really benefits from being on a big screen too. Voice acting is great, not to mention the casting. Good on ya. They really chose the right actors for the job. Never are you distracted with that annoying feeling that you heard that voice before. (i.e Woody Allen as an ant.) Personally what I really appreciated most about this movie was that they truly made a family film, a film every age can enjoy. I always felt that with ""Cars"", even though a great film, wasn't made for adults. Just look at all the toys and products that had Lightning McQueen's face on them and you will see what I mean. This film has an off-beat, yet adult story of a young chef/rat trying to make it as a cook. It deals with bad bosses, relationships with co-workers, and job stress. In fact you replace the rats with kids from a rough neighborhood, and you have a drama/comedy about class struggle. The fact is, this was a film about real life (minus cooking rats). Not a cute story about a world run by talking cars. If I had to nitpick. And it really would be nitpicking. I would have to say that the film felt about 15 minutes too long. Also the basic story formula was familiar movie territory. Fish-out-of-water mixed with a pseudo-Cyrano de Bergerac story. It worked, but I was very aware of what I was watching. The evil chef sorta felt like Dean Wormer from Animal House. Thats all. Just little things here and there sometimes felt very familiar. I will say this. I am proud of Pixar for maturing in their storytelling. I was starting to notice that every film by them was a rescue story, again! Thank you for not making another. It is a welcome change. Also, to it's credit, Ratatouille was not nearly as gaggy as the earlier Pixar releases. Instead they relied more on clever facial expressions and situation comedy. Plus gags, when present, were more visual. Nothing like the stupid one-liners, i.e ""find a happy place"" in other Pixar films. (Hey it's a fish that needs therapy, yuk yuk!) I'll say this, Pixar used to really emphasize the novelty aspect of computer animation. It seemed like they use to make a game out of reproducing cheese puffs, or toy packaging, or making sea turtles into stoners. This was getting old for me. I really enjoyed the change of pace in Ratatouille. Lush scenery, realistically detailed rats and objects, and perfectly rendered lighting. Very impressive. I wouldn't be surprised if this won for best animated feature at next years Oscars. Well done!","

"Ratatouille","fwomp","7 September 2007","Maintaining the status quo can be damaging to films, especially thanks to the highly popular animations that have graced the silver screen (SHREK, THE INCREDIBLES, HOODWINKED!) Audiences get bored if all you show us is the same ol' same ol'. And this is where RATATOUILLE runs into trouble.Written and directed by Brad Bird (who also did The Incredibles and THE IRON GIANT), Mr. Bird has fallen into a small rut; one that I hope he doesn't remain in. Yes, the animation was great. Yes, the voices were wonderful. Yes, the story was cute and funny. But there was nothing new. We've seen these themes over and over and over again, and it's becoming a bit tiresome.Instead of a superhero family or a misunderstood ogre, this time we've got an English speaking French rat (don't ask) who's taste for expensive foods  and not garbage  gets him into trouble. Living the life of the dull and mundane with the rest of his extended family, Remy (Patton Oswalt, RENO 911!: Miami) soon has buckshot whizzing by all of his furry brethren. Removed from his familial upbringing, Remy turns quickly toward his love for rich foods. His astutely attuned nose leads him to Paris (as does a ghostly visitation from a world famous chef known as Gusteau voiced by Brad Garrett, MUSIC AND LYRICS), where he finds a now corrupted and dying restaurant named after its formerly famous cook (the aforementioned Gusteau). He also runs into the newly hired garbage boy named (not funnily) Linguini (Lou Romano, CARS). After being captured in the kitchen, Remy is caged and taken to the river by Linguini where he's told to dispose of the rodent in the nearby river. But Remy and Linguini soon realize they can understand one another, and Linguini can't bring himself to the kill the little fella. What does happen, though, is that a bizarre relationship builds and Linguini quickly becomes the soup chef thanks to Remy's ability to identify delectable food. Hidden under Linguini's hat (literally), rat and human become the master-blaster (ROAD WARRIOR reference) of Gusteau's restaurant.Swirling around this story is also a love interest between another chef named Collette (Janeane Garofalo) and Linguini, the battle between thievery and survival that Remy must address when his extended rat family pops in, and, of course, the battle that Linguini must do with a very Tim Burtonesque looking food critic named Anton Ego (the estimable Peter O'Toole, CASANOVA).Not surprisingly, everything works out in the end thanks to human ingenuity and rodent accompaniment.But, again, this isn't something we haven't seen before. It's old terrain covered many times, which is why I'm only giving it 6 stars. Had it not been for the awesome voice of Mr. O'Toole as the food critic, it may not have gotten even that.Kids will enjoy the action. Parents will like the familiar territory. And let's hope that the two can talk about the necessity for rats to NOT be in restaurants.","

"Ratatouille","christian94","10 July 2007","One night, three great movies. Let's start with the appetizer: Ratatouille.This family fun, yet mainly mature, sweet and sarcastic tale is Brad Bird's reserved creation. Even if in Paris, the setting is dingy and involves rats in a kitchen. Yet, Bird is the one to receive an original screenplay Oscar nomination for ""Incredibles, The (2004)"", an animated movie about superheroes. Even so, it comes as a pleasant surprise to see Bird's writing and directing easily transcend this potentially contrived plot and make a funny and heartfelt movie in almost every aspect. The message it carries is positive and poetic and the film is forgiven its occasional slapstick comedy moments or predictability to (hopefully) make it slightly more appealing to the younger audience and thus more marketable.The initial introduction and characterization had me entertained, but slightly worried, but once the film got rolling, I was pretty much enthralled throughout: out-loud laughing, smiling or fighting a tear. A feel good movie and a good story. Don't expect Shrek's flatulence or average talking-animal humour. Expect more of the witty humour from The Incredibles, minus the action, plus a bit more depth in dialogue and human soul-searching. Disney's magic? Well, this film has the intangible that makes it all work together.","

"Ratatouille","AloysiusWeasley","30 December 2007","*********MINOR, MINOR SPOILERS*********** You can find out what this movie is about from the front page, so I'm just going to critique it here.For starters, this movie got two stars from me instead of zero because the animation was quite unique and paid great attention to detail. Not anywhere near say, a Studio Ghibli level of technique of animation, but quite good, nonetheless.On to the faults, of which there are MANY. Let me just list them, for easier reading: - The whole plot is RIDICULOUS. Leaving aside that this is animation (which does often take many more liberties than would be allowed with non-animated productions), rats running a kitchen (Gross!)? A chef being controlled by his hair? No one ever seeing said rat back lit under a white hat? A rat that just ""somehow"" knows how to make all these dishes, knows what the culinary equipment does, and knows exactly what spices to use, EVERY time? Really.I almost never say this (usually I campaign for the other end of the spectrum), but this movie is WAAAY too long! It really begins to drag and blend together by about a third of the way in, and it was a real struggle to keep watching. I can think of so many more deserving movies that should have been gifted with such a time allotment! - Can you find a sympathetic character in this? Good, I couldn't either. Characterization was definitely lacking, as well as motivation - pretty much every character in this movie is flat, uninspired, and frankly, annoying and grating.Humor that is ""mostly adult-oriented""? PLEASE. I think I cracked a smile about five times during this one, and maybe a giggle. It's so overloaded with saccharine garbage you will be nauseated.On a more personal note, if you don't like rats and find their little pestilence-ridden bodies distasteful, this is NOT the movie for you. Also, I'm not quite sure why so many animated flicks in the past few years have made the focus of their films detestable creatures (rats, bees, ants, other insects, mice, pigs, birds, and did I mention how many movies there are about bugs?) The last good movie I saw with anything that counted as a predator would be Lion King. What is it, some sort of vulnerability ploy? - I'm no expert on how European kitchens work, and there are many other flaws with this movie that many other excellent reviewers have pointed out. Don't let my review be the only one you read, and PLEASE don't take the number of stars given this one seriously! Every Pixar and Disney employee must have been told to give this a great review and number of stars, on ALL the major movie sites! Bottom line, looking for a better rat/mouse-type animated movie? How about The Rescuers, or one of the Fievel/American Tail movies, or best yet, The Rats of Nimh. Looking for a better movie by Pixar? Personally, I'd say Toy Story one or two, The Incredibles (fabulous, original work right there), Finding Nemo, or you know what, anything but this movie, and I think A Bug's Life isn't that great, either.To me, Pixar was one of the top American animation companies not just for their above-par animation techniques, but because their movies had one foot in the real world, while the other spun off into the realm of the fantastic. The Incredibles was the best example of this - I mean, superheroes being sued for saving a suicidal person? FABULOUS idea! But then they came out with Cars. I watched it and was nearly as annoyed as I was with this feature. Why were the cars there? Who made them? Questions like that. This movie tried to go back to their original formula, but flopped, and honestly, I blame new input from Disney for this. Hopefully, they'll do better in making future films, and I'll continue to wonder how this film got so many positive rating (and how many studio people helped make this so).","

"Ratatouille","nickdesigns","28 November 2007","So I just watched Ratatouille on DVD. Like Incredibles, I dismissed this as another lame Pixar movie and saw Spidey 3 instead(big mistake).But I gave Incredibles a chance and ended up enjoying it a little more than I thought. So I thought the same would happen with this movie. I was wrong.The story was boring. Really boring. Boring and predictable. Boring, predictable, and way too long. Incredibles had a deep engaging story that kept me hooked. Ratatouille had two stories that went nowhere. Remy trying to realize his dreams of being a chef, and Linguini trying to realize his dream of not being a tool. It seemed like a good formula, well it would have if we haven't seen it in 2000+ other movies. And every 10 minutes they had to keep reminding us what's the plot of the story, because they were that bad at showing it.The characters, oh god the characters. Flat and dull. They had no charisma, nothing unique about them, nothing that will make them stand out and join the ranks of greats like Bugs Bunny and Homer Simpson. Remy was just another big dreamer type. He works hard, get's knocked down, gets back up, and achieves his dream. Good for him, now what? He has the same backstory as about 1400 other Disney characters. And Linguni, the dude was a loser. A total loser, and he's stays that way through the entire film, and yet somehow he still get's to make it with the big-nosed chick. What was he there for? His only purpose was to make Remy look good. People say Linguini had very unique movements, but all he did was spin around a lot. What's unique about that. He had no personality, and he flaunted it. And obviously his voice actor didn't even care enough to try to make him at least sound interesting. Colette, she claimed to be a tough and sassy girl in a""man's kitchen"", yet all she did was fall for the biggest loser in France. Where's her self-esteem, they did absolutely nothing with her character. It's like Pixar isn't even trying to make us care about these characters. They're one-note and easily forgettable, soon to be pushed aside for the next bland set of characters, then the cycle begins anew. And my apologies to Patton Oswalt, he's one of my favorite comedians and people in general, but the voice acting was terrible. Flat and emotionless. They honestly couldn't just get guys like Billy West and Rob Paulsen. They would have made the movie 10x more interesting.Even with the great story and characters of the Incredibles, the animation still kept the movie bogged down. Ratatouille was no different. Everything felt so mechanical, so chained down. It didn't feel fun and exciting. It just made me wonder if they weren't gonna put any effort into trying to make the animation fun, lively, and surreal, why the hell didn't they do it in live action. All it had was just some fancy camera angles, thinking that would compensate, well, it didn't. Pixar strives too hard to make they're animation look more realistic, so much so that it loses another key component, believability(spell check). They have these uber realistic atmosphere and these ultra-fake looking humans, that it clashes and makes the movie look even more fake than it is. It doesn't suck you into the world they've created, it spits you out maliciously. One of the things I liked about the movie TMNT, they built this dark, gritty, comic style atmosphere and built it around the characters, and it worked, you were in that movie, it was believable. Ratatouille wasn't.Ultimately, I'm not surprised little kids like the movie, it was geared toward them, and they're the only ones who could enjoy it. All the adults that are saying this is the best movie ever, needs to retrieve their souls from Walt Disney's cold dead hands","

"Ratatouille","Dr_Coulardeau","2 August 2007","Everyone knew that Paris hotels had the biggest, friendliest and juiciest fleas in the world with whom all tourists fell in love at the first bite. A real legend these fleas of Paris Hotels. Ask Ms Paris Hilton: she will tell you everything about it and she can compare with the fleas of American prisons. But Walt Disney has decided to go a lot further in its debunking of Paris, to teach those damned urban frogs a good lesson since they don't seem to have understood that they had to make themselves very, very small after their being rejected for the 2012 Olympic Games. And the lesson is as hot as hell. All best restaurants in Paris have hired, as chefs in their kitchens, the ugliest and least hygienic people they could find, I mean the gutter and sewage rats, and there again Paris has a record: not so much as for the quality of their rats but as for the number of them. It is even murmured that unemployment has gone suddenly down in Paris because of this hiring policy of Paris hotels since all unemployed people in Paris, particularly in the ethnic northern and eastern suburbs, are nothing but rats basking in the moonshine. That will show how low these Frenchies of Paris have gone: their haute cuisine is done and produced by rats. You can be rest assured that in the next Walt Disney film they will show that French haute couture is in the hand of a bunch of pigs and French perfumes in the hands, or shouldn't I say in the sweaty shoes, of bedbugs, or who knows what other stinking beetle or skunk. The kids though love it and there is some humor here and there, and I must say the Parisians deserve it quite a lot because they are always obnoxious with foreigners, strangers and tourists. All serious study proves it with hard data. So they just get the change their fake forged bank notes deserve. But there are some myths that like going around in the world. Ratatouille has nothing to do with Paris since it is a dish prepared in Marseilles, originally, at least as far I know, though some dictionaries tell me it is from Nice. Same mistake. At least they do not bring up the most popular and famous dish of France in France today, i.e. couscous, that is prepared, it is well known in France, by some special species of rats, but this would have been racist. At least one thing will be sure: French fries will no longer be what they used to be. I bet they can be called fried rat's nests and enter the legend that in Haute Cuisine they don't have cockroaches, but they have coq au vin, and no one knows what's the connection between the two, nor which one is better than the other. At least in Paris you can't make the difference. I must admit though the few views of the Eiffel Tower were quite appetizing.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne","

"Ratatouille","valadas","6 September 2007","In formal and technical terms this movie is undoubtedly very good but not better than the average recent other computer animated movies. Its main original feature is the story itself which tells us about the rat that wants to be a chef and attains its aim after a lot of exciting vicissitudes. This movie has the successful peculiarity of making the viewer to take to the rats which are animals we are used to face as repugnant, distasteful and disease-carrier mainly in what relates with food. But here we sympathize with them indeed. Getting back to technical aspects, the design is stupendous, the puppets extremely original and expressive, the action runs at a sometimes hallucinating rhythm and the visual effects are of an amazing movement and perspective. This is one more excellent achievement in the field of animation movies.","

"Ratatouille","kgprophet","8 July 2007","Brad Bird really put himself on the line with this strange concoction of a film. The only way this concept could work for the length of a feature (at 1 hour and 50 minutes - that's an eternity in animation time), is to go all out. Indeed, that's what this epic does and succeeds. From a floating imaginary chef to hair pulling as puppetry, the film is stuffed full of little details and subplots. No, you can't let a film with a strange Tom and Jerry feel to it become the central part of the film, so the character of Linguini and his own strife counter-balance the rat's story. Indeed, Linguini, a clutz in the Jerry Lewis vein, carries the second half of the story, with the rat mostly disappearing in many scenes. What Brad Bird accomplishes, meanwhile, is that Pixar magic, where you get an unexpected emotional attachment to strange world they have created. So, in the end, this is not a story about a rat who likes to cook, it becomes the moral that anyone can try something new. AND - there are no dumb Randy Newman songs. The pacing is quick, there are a few good action scenes, and humour exists, but mostly forced. This is still more of an adult orient animated film (there is a love story), but the rat is cute and the unorthodox premise never bores. As uncertain to the reaction when the film opened, there is a solid timeless quality to the execution that will make it a classic. Something that could not be said about last year's ""Cars"".","

And celebrate is what I'm doing after seeing Ratatouille. I cannot think of another film that was so full of life and emotion presented in such a stunningly beautiful way. Whodathunk a rat in a kitchen could be a promising premise for a movie? But with this particular rat in this particular kitchen in the hands of this particular film maker in this particular studio it WORKS! Ratatouille teaches us about fulfilling your potential and following your dreams, and ultimately shows us the joy that comes with excellence (which could be the story of Pixar itself). Yes, I now believe a rat can indeed be a great chef! It is the stuff dreams are made of.","

"Ratatouille","Anonymous_Maxine","26 October 2007","I think Ratatouille is going to be most enjoyed by the kids and adults who are into cooking. I'm into cooking myself, but I mean SERIOUSLY into cooking, like people who are more interested in the kitchen of a fancy restaurant than in the food. The premise is pretty silly, a rat living in the sewers under the streets of Paris unwittingly discovers a talent for cooking that some of the most highly trained human chefs can't seem to attain, so he befriends a young boy, the garbage boy at the restaurant (who might remind you of young Wart from Sword in the Stone) and basically uses him as a puppet so he can get access to the kitchen. You see, other people working in the kitchen at fancy restaurants don't want a disease-infested rodent as a colleague, so there have to be some secrets. Needless to say, a lot of bizarre situations follow, as is to be expected when you have a rat controlling the head chef at a famous restaurant by hiding under his hat and pulling his hair. It's cute and heartwarming and entertaining, and what more do you really need?","

"Ratatouille","Ricky_Roma__","13 May 2008","As well made and as well written as Ratatouille is, there's also something rather uninspiring about it. It doesn't have the emotional heft of Monsters Inc. or Finding Nemo, it isn't as funny as Toy Story and it isn't as exciting as The Incredibles. Instead it's a tasteful film that evaporates from one's memory as quickly as a mediocre meal. There isn't much in this film to sink your teeth into.Perhaps the most disappointing thing about Ratatouille is its lack of laughs. After all, this is a comedy first and foremost. Therefore it's not a great sign when you only laugh out loud once.The scene that got this response involved the scummy Chef Skinner. He begins to see rats and he's growing increasingly paranoid about his ability to control the restaurant. So he speaks to a confidant about his fears and starts clicking his fingers, going, 'Ooh, it's here', pretending to see the rodent everywhere. It's marvellously silly, something that's actually a rare commodity in a highly controlled film.The problem that this high level of control has is that you can see almost everything coming. At the beginning you know that Remy the rat is going to be separated from his family and that he'll have to discover himself. You also know that he'll face challenges and strike up an alliance with a fellow outcast. And you know that near the end something bad will happen so that he has a challenge to overcome in the final act. You also know, because the guys at Pixar are smart, that Remy will succeed in the end but that his victory will be on a personal rather than grandiose scale. Consequently you see all the beats coming  there's nothing here that's going to take you by surprise.That isn't necessarily a problem. Predictability needn't diminish a film's power to entertain. But the stuff that connects the beats is hardly top-drawer material. It's very run of the mill.Which is a shame when a film is as technically accomplished as Ratatouille is. The animation is beautiful and the Paris that is presented here is gorgeous  there are some absolutely stunning panoramic shots and the scene between Remy and Linguini by the Seine drips with atmosphere. I also adored Remy's expressions  the rat can't actually talk with humans, instead he has to nod or shrug his shoulders, and it was always clear what he was trying to say.Another superb piece of animation is when a sleeping Linguini is cooking. You see, this kid can't cook to save his life, and Remy the rat who can cook very well isn't allowed in the restaurant because, well, he's a rat, so they develop a technique where Remy sits on Linguini's head (under his hat) and by pulling on his hair he's somehow able to coordinate the boy. Well, there's a scene where Remy is doing this while Linguini is asleep. But the kid has sunglasses on, so one of his work colleagues doesn't realise that she's talking to someone who's asleep  the gormless expressions and twitchy body movements are a joy to watch.But this puppeteering does make you wonder once or twice. There's a romantic sup-plot between Linguini and the film's only female cook. But the kid only kisses the girl because Remy is pulling his hair and controlling his body. Would Linguini know how to kiss otherwise? And there's a scene where Linguini and his girlfriend ride off on her motorbike. Somehow, in the heat of it all, Remy loses his grip on his pal and the couple ride off alone. Is the kid able to perform without his master rat puppeteer? Well, that's probably a yes, as the couple remain together until the end of the film.One thing that's immediately clear when watching Ratatouille is how good Pixar are at action. All the action scenes are flawless. My favourite is the scene where an old lady spots Remy in her house and begins trying to shoot him. She shoots her house up so much that the ceiling comes crashing down. But then we see that hundreds of rats have fallen down and they're staring at her. It's beautifully timed. And the action that follows where the old lady shoots at the rats from a bridge as they try and make a river escape is impeccable as well.And then there's the scooter chase, where the evil chef Skinner chases our hero. It's fabulous. But at the same time you kind of get the feeling that it's a little tacked on. The film knows it hasn't had an action scene in a while, so it throws one in just in case anyone has nodded off.But it's the attempts to keep everyone entertained with action and conflict and all the plot points tied up that make Ratatouille more ordinary than it should be. The need to have a story with twists and turns detracts from the sweetness of the film. Because the film is all about doing your best  it's about pursuing your dream and not giving up. But although the end of the film is lovely, I kind of felt that I didn't deserve to feel as warm and fuzzy as I did  I didn't think the film had earned this response; the end is great, but the rest is so-so.But speaking of the ending, I do like the way that Remy succeeds on his own terms. It would be too silly for him to become a famous Parisian chef, admired and respected by all. But the fact that he eventually has his own place and does his own thing is a good lesson for all  celebrity or fame should never be anyone's goal; instead you should pursue pleasure and contentment. That's the road to self-fulfilment and happiness.","

"Ratatouille","ricky-1750","10 November 2007","Some of the best animation I have ever seen, and the characterizations, the voice talent, the story .... all first rate. I don't know when I've enjoyed myself so much.At first, I'll admit, I was so focused on the detail of the animation (the water on Remy's fur, actually, the animation of the water period), but I soon got so sucked into the story that I stopped being distracted.I especially liked that the character of Remy (although he could read) did not have the ability to speak to the humans. That one fact added so much to the humor, but also to the pathos and the misunderstandings between the two.I'm glad I took a little something from the budget to buy this on DVD. I didn't go see it in the theater (and now I regret that decision), but I know I'll watch it a few times a year from now until I breathe my last.I'm 55 and don't have any children, so I have nothing to go by, but I didn't see anything in the film that would upset a child. Remy ends up in some peril, but it never lasts for long, and at the very least this isn't one of those films where we have young Remy blamed for and dealing with the death of a parent. That's a plus in my book.I just plain loved this movie. I can't think of a bad thing to say about it.","

"Ratatouille","dminkster","4 June 2009","I was really disappointed in the film, it didn't have much of a story line, and the characters weren't as filled out as usual. I can't tell if it was the writing, or the voice performances, but I really didn't much care for it. There wasn't the strong motivation of Nemo, for instance, where they HAD to find Nemo. Remy simply wanted to be a great cook, but there was no real driving force behind this want. The relationship between him and what's his name, the young chef (see I can't even remember his name) was so ho hum, not vital enough to drive the picture. And there were way too many animated humans, unlike Nemo and Pixar's previous efforts. I am probably in the minority, but animated human characters just don't get it for me. Animated animals, cars, chairs, fine, humans, no. Actor wise, I think Peter O'Toole was the most successful in his characterization, and the film could have used some more voice talent of his level. The voice of Remy didn't capture any excitement, energy, nothing vital or arresting. Like wise Brad Garret as the Ghost Chef. I loved him on Raymond, but he didn't really find a character here, however he wasn't alone. Maybe my expectations were too high, but Pixar has never let me down and I expected this to be right up there with their others.","

"Ratatouille","walksofar","22 June 2007","Finally an animated children's flick i enjoyed. The visual experience alone, makes up for a great time. Remy, the main character in the movie, has to be one off Pixars best animations. That being said, the entire movie is some of Pixars best work.Over the past few weeks, different movies have come and gone, from all the 'threequels' to the 3rd penguin related movie in 2 years, Ratatouille is by far my favorite.With a beautiful story, a tight plot, and incredible voice offers, the movies is a refreshment from Hollywood's incredible unoriginality in the past few years. I was particularly surprised by the joy and even amusement I received from watching this flick. More often then not, children's flicks, incorporate the typical fart joke and other assortments of toilet humor that children find oh so amusing for reasons unbeknownst. Ratatouille manages to stay amusing with out having to use fart jokes, but still uses humor that children can appreciate and enjoy. A happy ride all the way throughPart of the films originality comes from the wonderful use of animation to tell the story, from the various chasing scenes (you'll know them when you see them), to my favorite scene involving an incident with the health inspector, the movies animation takes you in and never lets go.An original, amusing and extremely well done animated children's film. For those of you with kids, this is the must see movie of the summer. And if you don't have kids, watch it anyways, you'll definitely enjoy it.10/10 - go see it.","

"Ratatouille","jpschapira","13 March 2009","Maybe it's possible for anyone to cook, but we can't deny that there would have to be a clear agreement on what the expression 'cooking' means. If we're talking about the kind of cooking Remy -the main character of ""Ratatouille""- does, it certainly becomes unimaginable that, excuse my repetition, ""Anyone can cook"" (the title of Chef Gusteau's book and Remy's inspiration). But as food critic Anton Ego says, ""great cooking can come from unexpected places"". And I still haven't mentioned Remy is a rat.Brad Bird's ""Ratatouille"" is the most unusual of Pixar's productions and one of the strangest animated full-length pictures ever made. Unlike Pixar's previous achievements, it doesn't a hero in a crusade, with a final objective in mind. Remy wants to be a cook and expresses his desire to the amazement of others (his sense of smell is so good that he becomes the 'poison detector' of his family's food, and that's as far as his father recognizes his talent), but it's not the film's overall goal, where everything is usually directed. Remy doesn't even make friends during his journey (to call it a name), so we don't get a wide gallery of characters; only Chef Gusteau (deceased and an imaginary friend that can't really help the rat) and Linguini, a young guy who's Gusteau's unrecognized son and ends up cooking the dishes Remy's always dreamed of in the most unexpected of situations, thus providing a sort of conflict for the movie and the figure of a villain in Chef Skinner.All of this takes place in 'Gusteau's', the restaurant of the deceased chef, which is almost the only scenario of the film, that Bird exploits without rest (watch one scene in which plenty of rats are hiding in the kitchen and try their best not to be noticed: it's classic animation, classic Disney). Because it's not much what the Bird and the movie need to create an instant classic; everything is reduced to basics and works. One relationship (between Remy and Linguini) and the struggles it involves for each one to get what he wants.It's also in this aspect that ""Ratatouille"" stands out as one of the most original animation pieces ever made. We've seen animals talking to each other a thousand times, and in a lot of occasions we've seen them trying to talk to humans, but humans never understand. However, even when they might miraculously get human help to achieve their goals, their success occurs entirely in the animal world, wherever that is, among animals. We never forget everything is fiction, but in ""Ratatouille"" Remy's dream comes true (with human help) in the real world; in France, in Paris.I liked ""Happy Feet"" because Mumble danced along and helped his race because of his own merit. But those penguins saw humans as 'aliens', and didn't understand the weapons they used to harm them (in fact, they even saw some of them as gifts). Remy and his family know what men do to rats, but deep inside this 'little chef' believes that there's some good in the world. And he makes it throughAmong humans.","

"Ratatouille","jboothmillard","27 February 2008","From Pixar, the geniuses behind Toy Story and Monsters, Inc., and director Brad Bird (The Iron Giant, The Incredibles) this is another pleasant experience. Basically, young rat Remy (Patton Oswalt) lives with his brother Emile (Peter Sohn) and father, leader of the pack of rats, Django (Brian Dennehy), and because of his great sense of taste and smell, he is a rat poison checker. But he dreams of becoming a great chef, like his hero Auguste Gusteau (Brad Garrett), who he often imagines talking to. The rats escape the house when the old woman living there discovers them, but Remy is separated from his family, however he does find good luck when he sees that he has been living under Paris for all long, and he heads to Gusteau's restaurant. There he encounters Linguini (Lou Romano), who spots the rat putting ingredients into a soup that he almost spoilt, and when it is taken away to a customer, who they didn't realise was a food critic, everyone believes it was Linguini, and chef Colette (Janeane Garofalo) convinces nasty owner Skinner (Sir Ian Holm) not to fire him, as long as he can recreate the same soup. Linguini realises Remy knows how to cook and can understand him, so they soon form a ""partnership"", and to make Linguini do what he wants Remy controls him by pulling his hair. After a long while, Linguini is made to look like a great chef, and unfortunately for Skinner, he may be the heir of Gusteau, and obviously later it turns out to be true. Oh, and there is a small bit of love story with Linguini and Colette. Of course there are negative turns, when Skinner discovers it's Remy that is the genius, Remy sees the bad side to human when he is reunited with his family, but there is a happy ending, and the man they are desperate to please, food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole) gives his praise, and the kitchen is revealed to run by all the rats. Also starring Will Arnett as Horst, Julius Callahan as Lalo/Francois, James Remar as Larousse, John Ratzenberger as Mustafa, Teddy Newton as Lawyer (Talon Labarthe), and if you have the British version, it would be Jamie Oliver as The Health Inspector. The animation is (as always) impeccable, the characters are all well thought out, and the story is good fun and gives a great perspective into the restaurant and recipe creating world, all the family will enjoy this charming animated comedy. It won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, and it was nominated for Best Music, Original Score for Michael Giacchino, Best Sound, Best Sound Editing, and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it won the BAFTA for Best Animated Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Animated Film.

But the film has serious longeurs. It doesn't really live up to its very promising opening, and the chef villain is a very feeble character -- a real off-the-shelf job. In fact, I think this is colour-by-numbers much of the time. A formulaic, not very imaginative film that looks feeble beside, for example, Antz and the Shrek movies. I don't begrudge the time I spent with it, but given the resources and the background, it could have been much, much better.","

"Ratatouille","Tweekums","4 June 2012","Having enjoyed several other Pixar films; The Toy Story Trilogy, Wall-E and The Incredibles, I was keen to see this when it was on television recently, and while I don't think it was quite as good as those it was entertaining and as one would expect from Pixar it was beautifully animated.This film tells the story of Remy the rat; he isn't any old rat though; he has a nose for the finest foods and has even learnt how to cook from watching the great chef Auguste Gusteau on television. One day he is forced to flee from his rural home and is separated from his family in the sewers; when he climbs out he finds himself in the heart of Paris within sight of his hero's restaurant. When he looks through the window he sees garbage boy Linguini making some additions to the soup; realising the soup is being ruined he sneaks in and adds a few touches of his own... the soup is served to a critic and is a triumph... which doesn't please Skinner, the chef who took over after Gusteau died. Linguini is told he must make it again... something he can't do until he meets Remy. Being a rat Remy can't talk but they find a way to communicate and his cooking gets more and more popular; of course he can't tell anybody who is really doing the cooking! While this is going on we have a romantic subplot involving Linguini and Chef Colette, Skinner worrying that Linguini may be the rightful heir to Gusteau's restaurant and a visit from a famous critic who caused the establishment to loose one of its stars on his last visit.At almost two hours in length this did feel a little bit too long but not hugely so; the story was enjoyably and provided a decent number of laughs; largely from the deliberately unlikeable Skinner; although I suspect the biggest laughs for younger viewers will come from Remy's method of controlling Linguini. As well as laughs there were plenty of thrills, although none too scary; it is rated 'U' after all. The animation is absolutely stunning with the virtual camera moving in ways that gives shots that would be almost impossible in a live action film. As mentioned before this film is rated 'U' but that doesn't mean only children will enjoy it; there is plenty here to entertain viewers of all ages.","

Great voice acting. A lot of comedy. Even some elements of drama. Plus delicious food porn. It is like the final dish served by Remy (the rat). Hard work, craftsmanship and a lot of love that provide the magnificent end result. How can you not like this movie? From the moment we get introduced to Remy the rat you will believe that he is a wonderful cook. The fact that he is a rat makes it even funnier. We want Remy to succeed. Even when the people and rats think that it isn't possible. There are some lessons to be learned by adults and children. But most of this cartoon is I think a more adult approach on matters. On some rare occasions the pacing is a bit slow. And that is the only form of negative criticism I can think of.Ratatouille is a masterpiece.","

"Ratatouille","EijnarAmadeus","11 October 2007","Pixar is one of the most successful film-creators in recent history, and rightfully so, the re-defined the family-genre with TOY STORY, not just adding enormous depth to story and characters but also showcasing stunning animations. And TOY STORY wasn't a one-hit-wonder, it was followed by several successful outings; tell me one family who hasn't seen MONSTERS INC., CARS or FINDING NEMO and I will send them a DVD right away. And Pixar took their universe a step further with THE INCREDIBLES, an amazing character-study of superheroes left behind, trying to behave like regular people. Now, in 2007 Pixar does it again; RATATOUILLE is arguably their finest movie so far. Right from the outset and throughout it's entire runtime it was a warm and powerful feeling that kept me wanting more and more of this tale about a rat-going-cook in Paris. As in any Pixar movie, there are many supporting characters which helps making it fresh and always fascinating. And as in any child-friendly movie, there are moral and life lessons, and although they have behaved a bit cheesy from time to time, they serve well. RATATOUILLE portrays Paris in the most romantic and dearly beloved way imaginable in a animation-movie, and were better to put a story than in a classy restaurant? And one should not forget the impressive main characters here; the Rat Remy and the garbage-boy-turning-cook Linguini, both being Pixar at their peak capturing character-studies. Remy delivers serious speeches about his urge of getting out of the rat-life, like a human being he wants to create something new, and not eat the left-overs from something left behind. As he arrives Paris to discover his dreams, he realizes that his big idol, cook Gusteau, is dead. But Gusteau has already entered his mind, and Remy slowly evolves from being just a rat to becoming something quite extraordinary. Linguini is quite possibly the most likable character Pixar has created yet, a troubled but behaved, ambitious but not talented boy who lives in a small apartment, bicycles his way to work and blushes more than he blossoms, he isn't just the perfect sidekick to Remy with his funny behavior, but his romance with companion cook Colette is so sweet! RATATOUVILLE couldn't have been any better, this is truly as good as family-entertainment gets.","

Because many people on the forums are grumbling about how bad this movie is, let me tell you something; European culture is much different and sophisticated than here in America. There is a tender subtlety to this film that makes it speak to an older audience than previous films. So there isn't any violent action and anything of that kind, who cares? This a sweet, soft-spoken movie that hearkens back to when movies could be nonviolent and just as good. I definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys cooking.","

"Ratatouille","kreak21012","29 June 2007","I actually just got back from this movie and just had to give my opinion. Me and my friends went into the movie expecting nothing more than a few kicks and giggles. This movie, on the other hand, exceeded every one of our expectations. It already became my favorite Pixar and thats competing with monsters inc., toy story, and other greats. The animation was great! Also the music was perfect to fit this French themed movie. The voices they used were absolutely perfect for their characters and I loved the inspiring and creative story line that played through the entire movie. You know that Pixar always ends happily but this ending was just incredible how they wrapped the story up. I say 10/10 easy!","

"Ratatouille","oneloveall","2 November 2007","Pixar find themselves back on track after the slight misfire that was Cars, only stumbling a bit when introducing characters in the first twenty minutes. Afterwards, a joyous reverence for American computer animation's most prestigious unit became more and more apparent as viewers are led down this unique, heartfelt journey of one rodent's love for making tasty food the talk of all Paris. As downright preposterous some of the plot elements revolve around seem nearly everything works splendidly, from the inspired physics of Pixar's patently breathtaking chase scenes, comedic brilliance in a snobbish maturity of the antagonists, to the splendidly and poignantly captured climax. Ratatouille, if not the company's best work to date, represents a newfound creative realization for what is still hopefully only the beginning of these titan's computerized expressionism.","

"Ratatouille","thejoshualee","16 June 2007","Just got back from seeing it, a few things first to note:1. As mentioned, the visuals in this movie are amazing. But more than that, for me anyway, was the audio. It's very rare when the sound in a movie impresses me, but everything from the skitter of the rat's feet to thunder to sauces boiling, it sounded fantastic, more realistic than real life. The music was very nice as well.2. I don't know if a lot of people are going to like this film. The story has several threads and layers that the average ""Let's go to the movie and turn off our brain"" person won't understand or care for. In many ways the depth of this film has more in common with a graphic novel where subtle details are used to give large hints to character development, setting, and the like.3. The food looks amazing. It's interesting that we accept so much in animation, but that's because the characters and cars and many of the settings have a stylized, cartoony look, but the food looks like real food from the way cheese crumbles to the oil shimmering on the surface of a sauce. It made me so hungry. Now for the story:Remy seems to be the typical ""I have an impossible dream that I'll achieve through pluck and determination"" that's been seen in tons of Disney Cartoons, but there is a emotional and moral depth to him that makes him stand apart. The ideas of family vs dream are brought up, including the ethics of abandoning either side in favor of the other. Neither side is seen as good or bad entirely as Remy's responsibility to family is tested against his love of cooking. His father's worry and distrust of the humans is completely justified, while his dream being a chef is also justified, and the two seem incompatible. Cooking makes a surprisingly appropriate analog for a story about following dreams. The conflict between Remy, who has the talent, and Linguini who has the face is, again, morally deep and the stuff of good stories. Also, the question of selling a talent out for the cheap buck is brought up. There were a few times I wondered how they would provide a happy ending, but they did. Many characters go through an appropriate change that has you rooting for them, though not all of them do. A realism that sometimes, when the chips are down, people you thought were your friends will leave you, which makes the undercurrents of the importance of family much more pertinent. Much like the subject of the movie, the movie itself seems to break a lot of rules: There is an abundance of internal dialog, which is suppose to be a no-no, the main character is not only a rat, but a rat that makes some questionable decisions. Linguini starts out as an apathetic wannabe who transforms into a power crazy jerk, (before learning the lesson), there are a lot of very drastic moments of suspension of belief (pulling hair being able to manipulate the body for one). But like the food Remy cooks, it works and it works well. bottom line, I loved it. one to ten I'd give it a 9.5. Not only one of Pixar's best, but one of the best cartoons I've ever seen. I hope that future cartoons can break out of the ""Shrek"" rut of simple gags and stock characters to present a more complex and entertaining show like this, but, again, I doubt it will do very well. Too complex and leveled for the average cartoon lover, but it will be part of my movie collection for sure (and I don't buy many movies).","

COMPUTER ANIMATION
FAMILYThe set up has gifted cook who happens to be a rat named Remy, the story co-written and directed by Brad Bird and Jan Pinkava, that may have been inspired by an actual story about a renowned chief, whose committed suicide as a result of a single negative review by one of France's harshest food critics, which restaurants depend solely on reputation, leaving a well known motto and legacy ""Anyone can cook!"" And has Remy the rat teaming up with a teenage clumsy bumpkin, with aspirations to be good at something. Depicting a particular ""60 minutes"" segment about a well renown chief who committed suicide as a result of a single negative review just because restaurants depend on reviews than on the food itself. Well made and resonating which is understandable why the setting has to be there as opposed to anywhere else. Anyways, the idea is ingenious since the word 'rats' in general is a very disgusting word, but the movie suggests what if there's such thing as a gifted 'rat' who possess the natural ability to be a great cook, and capable to understand the English language but unable to speak it- I find that this concept alone is brilliant, and 'can' be considered since rats/ mice are often used for animal testing. Ratatouille (voiced by Patton Oswald) can physically speak with other fellow rats and upon speaking to humans, he can only nod his head up or down, meaning that he understands. And whatever I mention is only few of many other themes/ issues this film deals with and is only the cream of the crop. This film also includes the reality of harsh food critics or critics in general, and that's nothing in comparison to other issues this film deals with, all blended in to this involving story line. My only downside is that it's just a tad too long and that some of those minor scenes wasn't necessary. Voices also include Ian Holm, Lou Romano, Brian Dennehy, Brad Garrett, Janeane Garofalo, Will Arnett and Peter O' Toole as the harsh food critic!","

"Ratatouille","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","7 November 2009","I base this upon the 2-Disc Special Edition. This definitely does a thing or two differently than other 3D flicks... as an example, instead of doing tricks for the audience with camera and animation, it feels more like a movie that happens to be all CG. The movements are very realistic, and in a lot of ways, this actually doesn't strain credulity. That's, of course, not counting the main concept. Why must Hollywood always oversimplify psychology and the complexity of the human brain? Also, am I the only one whose had enough of critics being regarded as bitter and crusty old jerks who just like to pick apart the work of others? People, if their judgments bother you that much, *stop listening to them*, it's not a difficult thing to do. The plot is OK, though it doesn't all make sense. Voice acting is marvelous, everyone sounds exactly right. The characters are well-written, they come off as people that could exist outside of fiction, and few are annoying. This is visually well-done, immense level of detail, and grand, vivid color and lighting. The romance feels tacked on, and in fact Linguini is dangerously close to being completely useless in this. I don't really find this funny, however, someone put forth that it's really a drama for kids to a greater extent than a comedy, which I largely agree with. It often tries too hard for laughs when it does go for such. There is intensity and potentially disturbing content in this, as well as one use of a moderately strong word. The DVD comes with Lifted and Your Friend the Rat, the shorts(that I will review on their individual pages) several well-done featurettes, a handful of deleted scenes(in early stages) and some trailers. I recommend this to fans of these films. 7/10","

"Ratatouille","sashank_kini-1","14 January 2008","Pixar has returned with a bang with its movie, Ratatouille which narrates the life of Remy, a rat who can cook and the consequences that occur when he helps a man who is the son of a famous chef but can't really cook, to cook.The great thing about Ratatouille is that it really defines the tag line: 'Anyone can cook' in such a heartwarming way that it captures the heart of all. Emotions are highlighted in such a pleasant way which isn't dull or mundane and can be understood by children. The slight jealousy between Linguini and his girl-friend when Linguini exceeds in cooking between the two even though she was her mentor, jealousy between Remy and Linguini when Linguini conceals the secret to his success, Remy torn up between Linguini and his family and many other emotions are shown so beautifully that people would forget that we are watching animated characters and rats.Everyone is great is the voice casting. I did not even care that much about the French accent that should've been shown as it was a great film. There is some adult humor in the film too and I was happy that they had it, breaking the Disney line of not including anything bad in the movie, which too is good but a few adult jokes can be included so that even adults get their share of laughter.All the characters are lovable. This is because of the magnificent animation and the detail in the character sketching. Some of the scenes were memorable, like the gun scene, the grand finale and when Remy tries to modify the soup after dodging a number of obstacles.Ratatouille is a must watch for all. 9 out of 10. A great Pixar movie with a great message- 'Anyone can cook'.","

"Ratatouille","steverino171","3 July 2007","Brad Bird's ""Ratatouille"" is a rich, textured film that explores several important themes while sustaining a strong moral core. The lead character, Remy, a rat with ironically refined tastes in matters culinary, embodies the film's adamantly pro-democratic theme of ""anyone can cook"" while overcoming anxieties about himself and his relationship with the humans of the restaurant that despise him (because he is a rat) or distrust him. Bird handles these matters with care and deliberateness, thus providing a powerful primer for the film's target audience on American democracy and the egalitarian can-do notion at its core.""Ratatouille's"" ideas about democracy revolve around Remy's relationship with humans. As it were humans are a necessity for Remy. He needs them to do what he does best: cook fine cuisine. He needs them to provide the ingredients. He needs them to handle the chores of cooking. He needs them to appreciate the food he creates. Thus, he forms a reluctant partnership with a young kitchen worker named Linguini who can provide a link to the world of fine cuisine and do his culinary buddings. Since their relationship must be kept secret (for obvious reasons), they become close friends, depending on each other for their dreams.Nevertheless, Remy's relationship with humans is not always so positive. In one particularly revealing scene, Remy's father tries to scare the prodigal rat into returning to the nestwhere he belongs. He brings Remy to a rat extermination shop where several rat corpses are displayed in the front window as advertisement. The scene frightens Remy into seeing that humans are indeed a threat to him and his kind. However, Remy soon sees through his father's intimidating tactics and recognizes that fear is a tool that imprisons us and keeps us from growing (an apt thematic turn considering the current culture of fear our news and broadcast media conveys). Remy refuses to succumb to his father's mistrust of humans and bravely confronts them in order to bring his dream of cooking wonderful foods (of giving something to the world rather than taking) to full fruition. He is an intrepid little rat with the courage to pursue his selfless dream.What a beautiful message this is. What a wonderful lesson for a child to learn. Unfortunately, ""Ratatouille's"" box office draw will undoubtedly pale in comparison to Michael Bay's ""The Transformers"" and its ilk. This is unfortunate. Of course, ""The Transformers"" serves a purpose too. It initiates its young male audience into the world of consumerism, materialism, chauvinism, and violence. It reminds us that there are terrible threats to our world and they must be conquered through violent action. It also teaches us that young men can and should find contentment in consumption. These are all important parts of American culture as well. So, I guess it's up to you as to which kind of ideals you want your child (and yourself) exposed to. That's the beauty of a democracy I suppose.","

"Ratatouille","Pjtaylor-96-138044","9 April 2021","'Ratatouille (2007)' tells the tale of a young rat with a refined nose and penchant for cooking who becomes involved with a hapless accidental chef when the pair realise that the former can puppeteer the latter by pulling his hair. The film isn't as silly as its premise may, perhaps, suggest. In fact, it brings with it a certain kind of realism - similar to the grounded vibe of Bird's other Pixar presentation, 'The Incredibles (2004)'. It's an enjoyable film that stays focused on character right the way through, presenting its anthropomorphised animals with as much sincerity and nuance as its humans. That's why it works as well as it does, really. It sticks pretty closely to standard story structure, but it hits the beats it needs to with aplomb and also includes a few surprising consequences for some of its more outlandish actions (something that's often overlooked in similar fare). It's also just a generally pleasant experience packed with energetic animation and appealing character designs. It's a well-written animated adventure that's perfect for the whole family. 7/10.",NA

First, the visuals: perfect. Definitely Pixar's best work yet in this department, hands down. Everything is warm, soft, very realistic yet painterly. Animation is topnotch, special effects like liquids are natural, and the ever-so-important fur was realistic. Colors were rich and deep; makes me wish that the world was that pretty.The sound was great, not one thing stood out as imperfect. The voice actors breathed life into the digital dolls and no voice actor sounded forced or unfitting for the character.The story was enjoyable, with many hilarious bits scattered throughout the otherwise heartwarming script. The main themes were not entirely original (being different, overcoming differences), but this was perhaps the most enjoyable presentation I've yet to come across.The film left me feeling very satisfied, a smile stretching from ear to ear. The story did seem to wind down at points, but the ending was very fitting and had me cheering the lovable characters. I was more than impressed (even with my high expectations), and might even consider this as the best Pixar film yet.Definitely a must-see; bring your family (or a date)!",NA
"Ratatouille","Lejink","7 April 2012","This has to be one of Pixar's finest and funniest features to date. While even now,I struggle to get my head fully around enjoying a film where a kitchen is invaded by rats to the extent that they at one point prepare and serve all the food in a top restaurant, even my natural hygienic revulsion was overcome in the end. What next, a playful killer shark with ideas on how to boost tourism at a holiday resort or a friendly viper who helps weed the garden...?Anyway, the setting of Paris gives the studio the chance to, in more ways than one, broaden its horizons, with new, funny characterisations, French locations and also interiors, from a five-star restaurant and its working kitchen to Linguini's shabby (later luxurious) Eiffel Tower-facing apartment. The storytelling skill and joke-count are as high as ever, but for me it's the detail in the art-work which impresses most.Of course, being an animated feature, means that the director can take a shot from any vantage point, but even so I was frequently surprised by the sheer audacity of some of the set-ups and edits which certainly kept me interested and helped the movie negotiate its sometimes tricky dual-plot line format. The film at first seems to reach a natural ending prematurely with the initial success of Linguini (and Remy) so that the coda of their having to convert the sternest critic in Paris could have seemed contrived and padded but the single scene where he's won over is probably the best in the movie and justifies the extra half-hour for the more muted but still happy ending.I'm normally not a fan of celebrity voice-overs in cartoon films (give the work to jobbing actors!) but even I enjoyed Peter O'Toole's star turn as the glacial critic who turns, but in truth he's no better than the rest of the cast in giving life to their pixilated creations. Being a Disney film, of course there has to be an element of playing to the young and so we get the usual sub-plot pitting a sort of bad-guy head-chef against our hero and the usual pick-and-mix of uplifting morals for all, but it's none too blatant and never a distraction.In short, this was a highly entertaining family feature, although I personally pity the parents of young children who on seeing this film will be pestered to buy them a pet rat for their birthday or Christmas!",NA

From a foodie point of view, they hit exactly upon the joy and excitement of invention and creation in a kitchen... not to mention the pure energy and atmosphere of a busy restaurant. One of Bird's beliefs is that animation does not necessarily equal children's entertainment, and this is true here... I don't think Ratatouille is going to be the breakout children's movie that The Incredibles was. Don't get me wrong; I think kids will enjoy themselves. The pace is brisk and the humor continual. But there are so many layers to experience here... this movie will definitely bear up well through repeated viewings.The visuals are tremendous, especially the views of a rat running through walls and underground. The music was also memorable, although there's no Randy Newman-ish lyrics here. I recognized the name John Gilkey in the credits, and indeed the loose-limbed flailing of the young chef is reminiscent of Gilkey's physical comedy... although a 100% Animation disclaimer at the end of the movie stated that no motion capture was used. Still, i would have loved to be a fly on the wall the day Gilkey was modeling movement for Pixar's animators!

A young man scurries down the steps towards the river's edge from his bicycle, looking over his shoulder every which way to see if anyone is around. With him is Remy who will soon be at the bottom of the river. He approaches the edge, ready to dispose of the innocent victim. By the way, Remy is a rat.The latest Disney/Pixar collaboration Ratatouille brings us through the streets of Paris and into the kitchen of what was once a five star restaurant. This witty and wonderfully put together animated feature is just another astounding accomplishment by the creators and animators who brought us Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles.We find ourselves following Remy, a Parisian rat whose taste buds are not satisfied with the everyday apple core and pizza crusts. His unique ability to create delectable treats that even a human can't resist ends up having him separated from his friends and family, but brings him to the kitchen of one of the most respectable restaurants in all of Paris. After sneaking into the kitchen, Remy rescues a sauce that has been ruined by Linguini accidentally and has the customers in an uproar about how delicious it is. Remy, after being spotted, is taken out by Linguini who must dispose of him but can't after figuring out that Remy can understand him. Linguini realizes that this rat has made the soup and must come up with a way of recreating the soup and keeping Remy a secret.The two must join forces in winning over the chefs, the customers, and the critics in order to keep the restaurant in business and to keep Remy alive. Remy figures out a way of manipulating Linguini's movements to prepare the food and keeping himself out of sight.Since Toy Story's release in 1995, every film since then has been a step up in the advancements that have taken place in the production of these films. The quality of the animation and the attention to detail is unbelievable. Every shot and every movement is a carefully drawn out plan with many levels. There is the lighting, the action on screen, the movement of the camera, sounds, and a wide spectrum of minute things that we don't even notice but are essential in creating a scene.Take for instance the city itself. The film mainly takes place in the kitchen, where Remy's family lives, and where Linguini lives. All of the in between scenes that are only on screen for a few seconds give the film this grand scope. The Eifel Tower is a a prominent piece of the Paris skyline. But the lights and cars and trees that surround it give it much more depth.One thing that has made all of these films successful are the ingenious stories and their characters. The writing for all of these films has always been solid and in tune with the message that is trying to be sent with each story. The glue that holds the story together is certainly the characters. The cast of voices include Patton Oswalt, Brad Garrett, Ian Holm, Brian Dennehey, Peter O'Toole, and a host of amazing voice actors who bring to life these lovable and at times characters. Pixels become actors.Anyone can cook. That is the motto of the great chef Gusteau. But what this really means is anyone can do anything. Even if all of the odds are against you like a rat trying to be a five star chef, you can do it. The film is easy to understand but it works for all ages. There is something here that everyone can enjoy. That is why these films have worked for so long. They make an impact on all age groups.You don't have to be a food connoisseur to appreciate Ratatouille. Even if you have never had ratatouille in your life, this movie will go down smooth and easy, filling you up with satisfaction and delight.",NA
"Ratatouille","OllieSuave-007","10 July 2015","Pixar's Ratatouille is an overly imaginative animated film (anybody would think so when watching rats cook food in Paris), where a rat named Remy dreams of becoming a French chef despite him being a rodent pretty much despised by all humans. After a run-in with an eccentric old woman in his home, he wounds up retreating to the restaurant Gusteau's in Paris, where his passion for cooking food intertwines with a chef-wannabe named Linguini.The animation is brilliant in a way that captures the wonders and beauty of Paris and the texture and aura of gourmet food. Unless you are really interested in cooking shows or culinary arts, the first part of the film might be a little dull to you as much of it is consumed with Remy's obsession about culinary arts, and the restaurant chefs blabbering about food and critics. However, the movie gets more interesting and plot picks up steam when Remy meets Linguini and tries to help cook food to impress the annoying Head Chef Skinner, all the while trying to fulfill his dreams at the same time.The portrayal of the rats and their physical movements were actually quite cute at times. The chemistry between Linguini and Chef Colette was mismatched and lacked charm. The animation of the rats were good, but the humans were a little more sub-par I thought, especially that of Linguini and Colette (can never understand those over-sized eyes and noses).Overall, it's a movie that will have you craving for gourmet food, visit Paris, and encourage you to fulfill your life goals. Not a bad Pixar movie.Grade B-",NA
"Ratatouille","saintorr","22 October 2007","Watched this my children (11 and 13) as a ""treat"". Sorry kids! I have been a big fan of Pixar from day one, but this movie just didn't work. Without a doubt the animation was excellent but where was the storyline, the characterisation and (sadly) the laughs? The strength of movies of the calibre of Toy Story is that within moments the audience forgets it is watching CGI and gets wrapped up in the story and characters. With Ratatouille the sole strength is the CGI.I would have much preferred to watch a movie with OK animation that had an interesting plot but here all the energy had been put into making rat fur look realistic.Gets 4 out of 10 for being visually stunning and beautifully executed. Would have grabbed a 10 if the script and characterisation had been up to expected Pixar standards.",NA
"Ratatouille","PopcornLovesMovie","2 July 2007","This is a movie that the whole family should enjoy. It is cute enough for young kids and deep enough for the older people. Plus, it's funny. Not very, but just funny enough to keep you entertained. The older folks can really connect with the story.The animation is truly an art. It looks very realistic and fluid spare a few of the scenes. They can make rats look cute...what am I saying, it's what they do :DI thank Disney for making movie enjoyable again for the whole family. The last few years had been a dark age for Disney family movies. I really hope that they can continue in this path for years to come. It's really no fun when parents have to sit through a movie which they don't enjoy.I will give it an 8.8 out of 10",NA
