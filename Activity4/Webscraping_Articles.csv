"1","Minimizing the Thompson Sampling Regret-to-Sigma Ratio (TS-RSR): a provably efficient algorithm for batch Bayesian Optimization","Zhaolin Ren, Na Li","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","This paper presents a new approach for batch Bayesian Optimization (BO), where the sampling takes place by minimizing a Thompson Sampling approximation of a regret to uncertainty ratio. Our objective is able to coordinate the actions chosen in each batch in a way that minimizes redundancy between points whilst focusing on points with high predictive means or high uncertainty. We provide high-probability theoretical guarantees on the regret of our algorithm. Finally, numerically, we demonstrate that our method attains state-of-the-art performance on a range of nonconvex test functions, where it outperforms several competitive benchmark batch BO algorithms by an order of magnitude on average.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 18:58:26 UTC (677 KB)"
"2","BloomGML: Graph Machine Learning through the Lens of Bilevel Optimization","Amber Yijia Zheng, Tong He, Yixuan Qiu, Minjie Wang, David Wipf","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Bilevel optimization refers to scenarios whereby the optimal solution of a lower-level energy function serves as input features to an upper-level objective of interest. These optimal features typically depend on tunable parameters of the lower-level energy in such a way that the entire bilevel pipeline can be trained end-to-end. Although not generally presented as such, this paper demonstrates how a variety of graph learning techniques can be recast as special cases of bilevel optimization or simplifications thereof. In brief, building on prior work we first derive a more flexible class of energy functions that, when paired with various descent steps (e.g., gradient descent, proximal methods, momentum, etc.), form graph neural network (GNN) message-passing layers; critically, we also carefully unpack where any residual approximation error lies with respect to the underlying constituent message-passing functions. We then probe several simplifications of this framework to derive close connections with non-GNN-based graph learning approaches, including knowledge graph embeddings, various forms of label propagation, and efficient graph-regularized MLP models. And finally, we present supporting empirical results that demonstrate the versatility of the proposed bilevel lens, which we refer to as BloomGML, referencing that BiLevel Optimization Offers More Graph Machine Learning.

Understanding and evaluating LLMs is vital before deploying them in critical learning environments, yet their unprecedented size and expanding number of parameters inhibits transparency and impedes trust when they underperform. Through a collaborative user-centered design process with several learning engineers building and deploying summary scoring LLMs, we characterized fundamental design challenges and goals around interpreting their models, including aggregating large text inputs, tracking score provenance, and scaling LLM interpretability methods. To address their concerns, we developed iScore, an interactive visual analytics tool for learning engineers to upload, score, and compare multiple summaries simultaneously. Tightly integrated views allow users to iteratively revise the language in summaries, track changes in the resulting LLM scores, and visualize model weights at multiple levels of abstraction. To validate our approach, we deployed iScore with three learning engineers over the course of a month. We present a case study where interacting with iScore led a learning engineer to improve their LLM's score accuracy by three percentage points. Finally, we conducted qualitative interviews with the learning engineers that revealed how iScore enabled them to understand, evaluate, and build trust in their LLMs during deployment.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 18:56:39 UTC (8,206 KB)"

The ability to learn continuously and indefinitely in a changing environment, and with resource constraints, is critical for real sensor deployments. However, existing designs are inadequate for practical scenarios with (i) streaming data input, (ii) lack of supervision and (iii) limited on-board resources. In this paper, we design and deploy the first on-device lifelong learning system called LifeHD for general IoT applications with limited supervision. LifeHD is designed based on a novel neurally-inspired and lightweight learning paradigm called Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC). We utilize a two-tier associative memory organization to intelligently store and manage high-dimensional, low-precision vectors, which represent the historical patterns as cluster centroids. We additionally propose two variants of LifeHD to cope with scarce labeled inputs and power constraints. We implement LifeHD on off-the-shelf edge platforms and perform extensive evaluations across three scenarios. Our measurements show that LifeHD improves the unsupervised clustering accuracy by up to 74.8% compared to the state-of-the-art NN-based unsupervised lifelong learning baselines with as much as 34.3x better energy efficiency.

We present KnowledgeVis, a human-in-the-loop visual analytics system for interpreting language models using fill-in-the-blank sentences as prompts. By comparing predictions between sentences, KnowledgeVis reveals learned associations that intuitively connect what language models learn during training to natural language tasks downstream, helping users create and test multiple prompt variations, analyze predicted words using a novel semantic clustering technique, and discover insights using interactive visualizations. Collectively, these visualizations help users identify the likelihood and uniqueness of individual predictions, compare sets of predictions between prompts, and summarize patterns and relationships between predictions across all prompts. We demonstrate the capabilities of KnowledgeVis with feedback from six NLP experts as well as three different use cases: (1) probing biomedical knowledge in two domain-adapted models; and (2) evaluating harmful identity stereotypes and (3) discovering facts and relationships between three general-purpose models.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 18:56:31 UTC (9,382 KB)"

The expressivity of GNNs with respect to their ability to discriminate non-isomorphic graphs critically depends on the functions employed for message aggregation and graph-level readout. By applying signal propagation theory, we propose a variance-preserving aggregation function (VPA) that maintains expressivity, but yields improved forward and backward dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that VPA leads to increased predictive performance for popular GNN architectures as well as improved learning dynamics.

Existing work on tool-augmented LLMs primarily focuses on the broad coverage of tools and the flexibility of adding new tools. However, a critical aspect that has surprisingly been understudied is simply how accurately an LLM uses tools for which it has been trained. We find that existing LLMs, including GPT-4 and open-source LLMs specifically fine-tuned for tool use, only reach a correctness rate in the range of 30% to 60%, far from reliable use in practice. We propose a biologically inspired method for tool-augmented LLMs, simulated trial and error (STE), that orchestrates three key mechanisms for successful tool use behaviors in the biological system: trial and error, imagination, and memory. Specifically, STE leverages an LLM's 'imagination' to simulate plausible scenarios for using a tool, after which the LLM interacts with the tool to learn from its execution feedback. Both short-term and long-term memory are employed to improve the depth and breadth of the exploration, respectively. Comprehensive experiments on ToolBench show that STE substantially improves tool learning for LLMs under both in-context learning and fine-tuning settings, bringing a boost of 46.7% to Mistral-Instruct-7B and enabling it to outperform GPT-4. We also show effective continual learning of tools via a simple experience replay strategy.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 18:50:51 UTC (7,453 KB)"

Prior work developed a general methodology to prove SQ lower bounds for this task that have been applicable to a wide range of contexts. In particular, it was known that for any univariate distribution $A$ satisfying certain conditions, distinguishing between a standard multivariate Gaussian and a distribution that behaves like $A$ in a random hidden direction and like a standard Gaussian in the orthogonal complement, is SQ-hard. The required conditions were that (1) $A$ matches many low-order moments with the standard univariate Gaussian, and (2) the chi-squared norm of $A$ with respect to the standard Gaussian is finite. While the moment-matching condition is necessary for hardness, the chi-squared condition was only required for technical reasons. In this work, we establish that the latter condition is indeed not necessary. In particular, we prove near-optimal SQ lower bounds for NGCA under the moment-matching condition only. Our result naturally generalizes to the setting of a hidden subspace. Leveraging our general SQ lower bound, we obtain near-optimal SQ lower bounds for a range of concrete estimation tasks where existing techniques provide sub-optimal or even vacuous guarantees.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 18:49:32 UTC (32 KB)"

Mainstream approaches utilize Convolutional Neural Networks or Recurrent Neural Networks to learn local energy feature representations of speech segments from speech information, but struggle with capturing global information such as the duration of energy in speech. Some use Transformers to capture global information, but there is room for improvement in terms of parameter count and performance. Furthermore, existing attention mechanisms focus on spatial or channel dimensions, hindering learning of important temporal information in speech. In this paper, to model local and global information at different levels of granularity in speech and capture temporal, spatial and channel dependencies in speech signals, we propose a Speech Emotion Recognition network based on CNN-Transformer and multi-dimensional attention mechanisms. Specifically, a stack of CNN blocks is dedicated to capturing local information in speech from a time-frequency perspective. In addition, a time-channel-space attention mechanism is used to enhance features across three dimensions. Moreover, we model local and global dependencies of feature sequences using large convolutional kernels with depthwise separable convolutions and lightweight Transformer modules. We evaluate the proposed method on IEMOCAP and Emo-DB datasets and show our approach significantly improves the performance over the state-of-the-art methods.

Harnessing the pure randomness of quantum vacuum noise, which stems from fluctuating electromagnetic fields, has shown promise for high speed and energy-efficient stochastic photonic elements. Nevertheless, photonic computing hardware which can control these stochastic elements to program probabilistic machine learning algorithms has been limited. Here, we implement a photonic probabilistic computer consisting of a controllable stochastic photonic element - a photonic probabilistic neuron (PPN). Our PPN is implemented in a bistable optical parametric oscillator (OPO) with vacuum-level injected bias fields. We then program a measurement-and-feedback loop for time-multiplexed PPNs with electronic processors (FPGA or GPU) to solve certain probabilistic machine learning tasks. We showcase probabilistic inference and image generation of MNIST-handwritten digits, which are representative examples of discriminative and generative models. In both implementations, quantum vacuum noise is used as a random seed to encode classification uncertainty or probabilistic generation of samples. In addition, we propose a path towards an all-optical probabilistic computing platform, with an estimated sampling rate of ~ 1 Gbps and energy consumption of ~ 5 fJ/MAC.

"13","A Sub-Quadratic Time Algorithm for Robust Sparse Mean Estimation","Ankit Pensia","Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)","We study the algorithmic problem of sparse mean estimation in the presence of adversarial outliers. Specifically, the algorithm observes a \emph{corrupted} set of samples from $\mathcal{N}(\mu,\mathbf{I}_d)$, where the unknown mean $\mu \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is constrained to be $k$-sparse. A series of prior works has developed efficient algorithms for robust sparse mean estimation with sample complexity $\mathrm{poly}(k,\log d, 1/\epsilon)$ and runtime $d^2 \mathrm{poly}(k,\log d,1/\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon$ is the fraction of contamination. In particular, the fastest runtime of existing algorithms is quadratic ($\Omega(d^2)$), which can be prohibitive in high dimensions. This quadratic barrier in the runtime stems from the reliance of these algorithms on the sample covariance matrix, which is of size $d^2$. Our main contribution is an algorithm for robust sparse mean estimation which runs in \emph{subquadratic} time using $\mathrm{poly}(k,\log d,1/\epsilon)$ samples. We also provide analogous results for robust sparse PCA.

Such hallucinations can be dangerous, as occasional factual inaccuracies in the generated text might be obscured by the rest of the output being generally factual, making it extremely hard for the users to spot them. Current services that leverage LLMs usually do not provide any means for detecting unreliable generations. Here, we aim to bridge this gap. In particular, we propose a novel fact-checking and hallucination detection pipeline based on token-level uncertainty quantification. Uncertainty scores leverage information encapsulated in the output of a neural network or its layers to detect unreliable predictions, and we show that they can be used to fact-check the atomic claims in the LLM output. Moreover, we present a novel token-level uncertainty quantification method that removes the impact of uncertainty about what claim to generate on the current step and what surface form to use. Our method Claim Conditioned Probability (CCP) measures only the uncertainty of particular claim value expressed by the model. Experiments on the task of biography generation demonstrate strong improvements for CCP compared to the baselines for six different LLMs and three languages. Human evaluation reveals that the fact-checking pipeline based on uncertainty quantification is competitive with a fact-checking tool that leverages external knowledge.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 17:44:17 UTC (3,070 KB)"

Statistical tools are often used for this purpose; however, traditional statistical methods often fail to capture decisive differences between systems' performance.

The methodology is designed to be universally applicable; however, it is illustrated using eight natural language competitions as case studies involving classification and regression problems. The proposed methodology offers several advantages, including off-the-shell comparisons with correction mechanisms and the inclusion of confidence intervals.

This restriction, parameterized by a window size and dilation factor, draws a spectrum of possible attention patterns between linear projection and self attention. Neighborhood attention, and more generally sliding window attention patterns, have long been bounded by infrastructure, particularly in higher-rank spaces (2-D and 3-D), calling for the development of custom kernels, which have been limited in either functionality, or performance, if not both. In this work, we first show that neighborhood attention can be represented as a batched GEMM problem, similar to standard attention, and implement it for 1-D and 2-D neighborhood attention. These kernels on average provide 895% and 272% improvement in full precision latency compared to existing naive kernels for 1-D and 2-D neighborhood attention respectively. We find certain inherent inefficiencies in all unfused neighborhood attention kernels that bound their performance and lower-precision scalability. We also developed fused neighborhood attention; an adaptation of fused dot-product attention kernels that allow fine-grained control over attention across different spatial axes. Known for reducing the quadratic time complexity of self attention to a linear complexity, neighborhood attention can now enjoy a reduced and constant memory footprint, and record-breaking half precision latency. We observe that our fused kernels successfully circumvent some of the unavoidable inefficiencies in unfused implementations. While our unfused GEMM-based kernels only improve half precision performance compared to naive kernels by an average of 496% and 113% in 1-D and 2-D problems respectively, our fused kernels improve naive kernels by an average of 1607% and 581% in 1-D and 2-D problems respectively.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 17:35:58 UTC (2,215 KB)"

To overcome these limitations, we propose an innovative model called Context-Based Multimodal Fusion (CBMF), which combines both modality fusion and data distribution alignment. In CBMF, each modality is represented by a specific context vector, fused with the embedding of each modality. This enables the use of large pre-trained models that can be frozen, reducing the computational and training data requirements.

Inspired by the success of RLHF, we study the performance of multiple algorithms that learn from feedback (Expert Iteration, Proximal Policy Optimization (\textbf{PPO}), Return-Conditioned RL) on improving LLM reasoning capabilities. We investigate both sparse and dense rewards provided to the LLM both heuristically and via a learned reward model. We additionally start from multiple model sizes and initializations both with and without supervised fine-tuning (\textbf{SFT}) data. Overall, we find all algorithms perform comparably, with Expert Iteration performing best in most cases. Surprisingly, we find the sample complexity of Expert Iteration is similar to that of PPO, requiring at most on the order of $10^6$ samples to converge from a pretrained checkpoint. We investigate why this is the case, concluding that during RL training models fail to explore significantly beyond solutions already produced by SFT models. Additionally, we discuss a trade off between maj@1 and pass@96 metric performance during SFT training and how conversely RL training improves both simultaneously. We then conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for RLHF and the future role of RL in LLM fine-tuning.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 16:36:29 UTC (3,796 KB)"

Not without a dash of irony, BO is often considered a black box itself, lacking ways to provide reasons as to why certain parameters are proposed to be evaluated. This is particularly relevant in human-in-the-loop applications of BO, such as in robotics. We address this issue by proposing ShapleyBO, a framework for interpreting BO's proposals by game-theoretic Shapley values.They quantify each parameter's contribution to BO's acquisition function. Exploiting the linearity of Shapley values, we are further able to identify how strongly each parameter drives BO's exploration and exploitation for additive acquisition functions like the confidence bound. We also show that ShapleyBO can disentangle the contributions to exploration into those that explore aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Moreover, our method gives rise to a ShapleyBO-assisted human machine interface (HMI), allowing users to interfere with BO in case proposals do not align with human reasoning. We demonstrate this HMI's benefits for the use case of personalizing wearable robotic devices (assistive back exosuits) by human-in-the-loop BO. Results suggest human-BO teams with access to ShapleyBO can achieve lower regret than teams without.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 16:13:32 UTC (2,583 KB)"

The key idea that underpins RAHMC is a departure from the conservative dynamics of Hamiltonian systems, which form the basis of traditional HMC, and turning instead to the dissipative dynamics of conformal Hamiltonian systems. In particular, RAHMC involves two stages: a mode-repelling stage to encourage the sampler to move away from regions of high probability density; and, a mode-attracting stage, which facilitates the sampler to find and settle near alternative modes. We achieve this by introducing just one additional tuning parameter -- the coefficient of friction. The proposed method adapts to the geometry of the target distribution, e.g., modes and density ridges, and can generate proposals that cross low-probability barriers with little to no computational overhead in comparison to traditional HMC. Notably, RAHMC requires no additional information about the target distribution or memory of previously visited modes. We establish the theoretical basis for RAHMC, and we discuss repelling-attracting extensions to several variants of HMC in literature. Finally, we provide a tuning-free implementation via dual-averaging, and we demonstrate its effectiveness in sampling from, both, multimodal and unimodal distributions in high dimensions.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 15:54:55 UTC (21,540 KB)"

While networks for tabular or image data are usually overconfident, recent works have shown that graph neural networks (GNNs) show the opposite behavior for node-level classification. But what happens when we are predicting links? We show that, in this case, GNNs often exhibit a mixed behavior. More specifically, they may be overconfident in negative predictions while being underconfident in positive ones. Based on this observation, we propose IN-N-OUT, the first-ever method to calibrate GNNs for link prediction. IN-N-OUT is based on two simple intuitions: i) attributing true/false labels to an edge while respecting a GNNs prediction should cause but small fluctuations in that edge's embedding; and, conversely, ii) if we label that same edge contradicting our GNN, embeddings should change more substantially. An extensive experimental campaign shows that IN-N-OUT significantly improves the calibration of GNNs in link prediction, consistently outperforming the baselines available -- which are not designed for this specific task.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 15:54:46 UTC (367 KB)"

It takes an information-theoretical posture to ask questions about what constitutes an interesting mathematical statement, which could guide future work in crafting an AI mathematician.

However, recent SSL approaches apply increasingly expansive model architectures and larger datasets, causing the rapid escalation of data volumes, hardware prerequisites, and overall expenses, limiting access to these resources to few institutions. Therefore, we investigated the complexity of contrastive SSL in computational pathology in relation to classification performance with the utilization of consumer-grade hardware. Specifically, we analyzed the effects of adaptations in data volume, architecture, and algorithms on downstream classification tasks, emphasizing their impact on computational resources. We trained breast cancer foundation models on a large public patient cohort and validated them on various downstream classification tasks in a weakly supervised manner on two external public patient cohorts.

First, we reaffirm prior conclusions that CLIP models can inadvertently absorb societal stereotypes. To counter this, we present a novel algorithm, called Multi-Modal Moment Matching (M4), designed to reduce both representation and association biases (i.e. in first- and second-order statistics) in multimodal data. We use M4 to conduct an in-depth analysis taking into account various factors, such as the model, representation, and data size. Our study also explores the dynamic nature of how CLIP learns and unlearns biases. In particular, we find that fine-tuning is effective in countering representation biases, though its impact diminishes for association biases. Also, data balancing has a mixed impact on quality: it tends to improve classification but can hurt retrieval. Interestingly, data and architectural improvements seem to mitigate the negative impact of data balancing on performance; e.g. applying M4 to SigLIP-B/16 with data quality filters improves COCO image-to-text retrieval @5 from 86% (without data balancing) to 87% and ImageNet 0-shot classification from 77% to 77.5%!

A key feature of GNNs is their use of graph structures as input, enabling them to exploit the graphs' inherent topological properties-known as the topology awareness of GNNs. Despite the empirical successes of GNNs, the influence of topology awareness on generalization performance remains unexplored, particularly for node-level tasks that diverge from the assumption of data being independent and identically distributed (I.I.D.). The precise definition and characterization of the topology awareness of GNNs, especially concerning different topological features, are still unclear. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework to characterize the topology awareness of GNNs across any topological feature. Using this framework, we investigate the effects of topology awareness on GNN generalization performance. Contrary to the prevailing belief that enhancing the topology awareness of GNNs is always advantageous, our analysis reveals a critical insight: improving the topology awareness of GNNs may inadvertently lead to unfair generalization across structural groups, which might not be desired in some scenarios. Additionally, we conduct a case study using the intrinsic graph metric, the shortest path distance, on various benchmark datasets. The empirical results of this case study confirm our theoretical insights. Moreover, we demonstrate the practical applicability of our framework by using it to tackle the cold start problem in graph active learning.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 13:33:30 UTC (3,789 KB)"

Significant strides have been made in leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to achieve remarkable success in these areas. However, in real-world scenarios, the training environment for models is often far from ideal, leading to substantial performance degradation of GNN models due to various unfavorable factors, including imbalance in data distribution, the presence of noise in erroneous data, privacy protection of sensitive information, and generalization capability for out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To tackle these issues, substantial efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of GNN models in practical real-world scenarios, as well as enhancing their reliability and robustness. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey that systematically reviews existing GNN models, focusing on solutions to the four mentioned real-world challenges including imbalance, noise, privacy, and OOD in practical scenarios that many existing reviews have not considered. Specifically, we first highlight the four key challenges faced by existing GNNs, paving the way for our exploration of real-world GNN models. Subsequently, we provide detailed discussions on these four aspects, dissecting how these solutions contribute to enhancing the reliability and robustness of GNN models. Last but not least, we outline promising directions and offer future perspectives in the field.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 13:10:37 UTC (11,722 KB)"

These algorithms often encounter challenges where they struggle with the curse of dimensionality, as maintaining a state-action-value function in such spaces becomes data-inefficient. In this work, we propose a novel off-policy trust region optimization approach, called Vlearn, that eliminates the requirement for an explicit state-action-value function. Instead, we demonstrate how to efficiently leverage just a state-value function as the critic, thus overcoming several limitations of existing methods. By doing so, Vlearn addresses the computational challenges posed by high-dimensional action spaces. Furthermore, Vlearn introduces an efficient approach to address the challenges associated with pure state-value function learning in the off-policy setting. This approach not only simplifies the implementation of off-policy policy gradient algorithms but also leads to consistent and robust performance across various benchmark tasks. Specifically, by removing the need for a state-action-value function Vlearn simplifies the learning process and allows for more efficient exploration and exploitation in complex environments","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 12:45:51 UTC (377 KB)"

In the search for white box models - as opposed to black box models, like random forests or neural networks - rule induction algorithms are a logical and promising option, since the rules can easily be understood by humans. Fuzzy and rough set theory have been successfully applied to this archetype, almost always separately. As both approaches to rule induction involve granular computing based on the concept of equivalence classes, it is natural to combine them. The QuickRules\cite{JensenCornelis2009} algorithm was a first attempt at using fuzzy rough set theory for rule induction. It is based on QuickReduct, a greedy algorithm for building decision reducts. QuickRules already showed an improvement over other rule induction methods. However, to evaluate the full potential of a fuzzy rough rule induction algorithm, one needs to start from the foundations. In this paper, we introduce a novel rule induction algorithm called Fuzzy Rough Rule Induction (FRRI). We provide background and explain the workings of our algorithm. Furthermore, we perform a computational experiment to evaluate the performance of our algorithm and compare it to other state-of-the-art rule induction approaches. We find that our algorithm is more accurate while creating small rulesets consisting of relatively short rules. We end the paper by outlining some directions for future work.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 12:34:03 UTC (23 KB)"

This setting is inspired by human-AI teamwork, where an AI-assistant helps its human user solve a problem, in this simplest case, collaborative optimization. We formulate the solution as sequential decision-making, where the agent we control models the user as a computationally rational agent with prior knowledge about the function. We show that strategic planning of the queries enables better identification of the global maximum of the function as long as the user avoids excessive exploration. This planning is made possible by using Bayes Adaptive Monte Carlo planning and by endowing the agent with a user model that accounts for conservative belief updates and exploratory sampling of the points to query.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 12:16:51 UTC (5,502 KB)"

The study involves a comprehensive evaluation across three different datasets: MSL, SMAP, and SWaT. Each dataset poses unique challenges, allowing for a robust assessment of the models' capabilities in varied contexts. The dimensionality reduction techniques examined include PCA, UMAP, Random Projection, and t-SNE, each offering distinct advantages in simplifying high-dimensional data. Our findings reveal that dimensionality reduction not only aids in reducing computational complexity but also significantly enhances anomaly detection performance in certain scenarios. Moreover, a remarkable reduction in training times was observed, with reductions by approximately 300\% and 650\% when dimensionality was halved and minimized to the lowest dimensions, respectively. This efficiency gain underscores the dual benefit of dimensionality reduction in both performance enhancement and operational efficiency. The MUTANT model exhibits notable adaptability, especially with UMAP reduction, while the Anomaly-Transformer demonstrates versatility across various reduction techniques. These insights provide a deeper understanding of the synergistic effects of dimensionality reduction and anomaly detection, contributing valuable perspectives to the field of time series analysis.

As a result, many expressions in these languages are shortened, and their meaning is inferred from the context. In this paper, we focus on the omission of the plurality and definiteness markers in Chinese noun phrases (NPs) to investigate the predictability of their intended meaning given the contexts. To this end, we built a corpus of Chinese NPs, each of which is accompanied by its corresponding context, and by labels indicating its singularity/plurality and definiteness/indefiniteness. We carried out corpus assessments and analyses. The results suggest that Chinese speakers indeed drop plurality and definiteness markers very frequently. Building on the corpus, we train a bank of computational models using both classic machine learning models and state-of-the-art pre-trained language models to predict the plurality and definiteness of each NP. We report on the performance of these models and analyse their behaviours.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 10:06:54 UTC (6,982 KB)"

Eliminating such stores enhances performance and energy efficiency by reducing memory access and bus traffic, especially in the presence of emerging non-volatile memory technologies. To achieve this, we propose a methodology consisting of: 1) the development of relevant ML models for explaining silent store prediction, and 2) the application of XAI to explain these models.

However, there are still numerous challenges that should be addressed to successfully implement sequential recommendations empowered by LLMs. Firstly, user behavior patterns are often complex, and relying solely on one-step reasoning from LLMs may lead to incorrect or task-irrelevant responses. Secondly, the prohibitively resource requirements of LLM (e.g., ChatGPT-175B) are overwhelmingly high and impractical for real sequential recommender systems. In this paper, we propose a novel Step-by-step knowLedge dIstillation fraMework for recommendation (SLIM), paving a promising path for sequential recommenders to enjoy the exceptional reasoning capabilities of LLMs in a ""slim"" (i.e., resource-efficient) manner. We introduce CoT prompting based on user behavior sequences for the larger teacher model. The rationales generated by the teacher model are then utilized as labels to distill the downstream smaller student model (e.g., LLaMA2-7B). In this way, the student model acquires the step-by-step reasoning capabilities in recommendation tasks. We encode the generated rationales from the student model into a dense vector, which empowers recommendation in both ID-based and ID-agnostic scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SLIM over state-of-the-art baselines, and further analysis showcasing its ability to generate meaningful recommendation reasoning at affordable costs.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 06:49:37 UTC (4,068 KB)"

In this setting, a network of agents seeks to design a transportation plan jointly, where the cost function is the sum of privately held costs for each agent. We reformulate the D-OT problem as a constraint-coupled optimization problem and propose a single-loop decentralized algorithm with an iteration complexity of O(1/{\epsilon}) that matches existing centralized first-order approaches. Moreover, we propose the decentralized equitable optimal transport (DE-OT) problem. In DE-OT, in addition to cooperatively designing a transportation plan that minimizes transportation costs, agents seek to ensure equity in their individual costs. The iteration complexity of the proposed method to solve DE-OT is also O(1/{\epsilon}). This rate improves existing centralized algorithms, where the best iteration complexity obtained is O(1/{\epsilon}^2).","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 06:47:45 UTC (877 KB)"

Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have enabled the integration of ML algorithms into IR, particularly in ranking systems. While there is a plethora of research on the robustness of ML-based ranking systems, these studies largely neglect commercial e-commerce systems and fail to establish a connection between real-world and manipulated query relevance. In this paper, we present the first systematic measurement study on the robustness of e-commerce ranking systems. We define robustness as the consistency of ranking outcomes for semantically identical queries. To quantitatively analyze robustness, we propose a novel metric that considers both ranking position and item-specific information that are absent in existing metrics. Our large-scale measurement study with real-world data from e-commerce retailers reveals an open opportunity to measure and improve robustness since semantically identical queries often yield inconsistent ranking results. Based on our observations, we propose several solution directions to enhance robustness, such as the use of Large Language Models. Note that the issue of robustness discussed herein does not constitute an error or oversight. Rather, in scenarios where there exists a vast array of choices, it is feasible to present a multitude of products in various permutations, all of which could be equally appealing. However, this extensive selection may lead to customer confusion. As e-commerce retailers use various techniques to improve the quality of search results, we hope that this research offers valuable guidance for measuring the robustness of the ranking systems.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 06:40:01 UTC (1,912 KB)"

This integration aims to enhance both long-term memory and long-horizon credit assignment. Through a diverse set of illustrative tasks, we systematically demonstrate that R2I not only establishes a new state-of-the-art for challenging memory and credit assignment RL tasks, such as BSuite and POPGym, but also showcases superhuman performance in the complex memory domain of Memory Maze. At the same time, it upholds comparable performance in classic RL tasks, such as Atari and DMC, suggesting the generality of our method.

While applying the dropout technique to the video modality enhances robustness to missing frames, it simultaneously results in a performance loss when dealing with complete data input. In this paper, we investigate this contrasting phenomenon from the perspective of modality bias and reveal that an excessive modality bias on the audio caused by dropout is the underlying reason. Moreover, we present the Modality Bias Hypothesis (MBH) to systematically describe the relationship between modality bias and robustness against missing modality in multimodal systems. Building on these findings, we propose a novel Multimodal Distribution Approximation with Knowledge Distillation (MDA-KD) framework to reduce over-reliance on the audio modality and to maintain performance and robustness simultaneously. Finally, to address an entirely missing modality, we adopt adapters to dynamically switch decision strategies.

While recent advancements in machine learning have introduced flexible methods for IV estimation, they often encounter one or more of the following limitations: (1) restricting the IV regression to be uniquely identified; (2) requiring minimax computation oracle, which is highly unstable in practice; (3) absence of model selection procedure. In this paper, we present the first method and analysis that can avoid all three limitations, while still enabling general function approximation. Specifically, we propose a minimax-oracle-free method called Regularized DeepIV (RDIV) regression that can converge to the least-norm IV solution. Our method consists of two stages: first, we learn the conditional distribution of covariates, and by utilizing the learned distribution, we learn the estimator by minimizing a Tikhonov-regularized loss function. We further show that our method allows model selection procedures that can achieve the oracle rates in the misspecified regime. When extended to an iterative estimator, our method matches the current state-of-the-art convergence rate. Our method is a Tikhonov regularized variant of the popular DeepIV method with a non-parametric MLE first-stage estimator, and our results provide the first rigorous guarantees for this empirically used method, showcasing the importance of regularization which was absent from the original work.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 05:38:56 UTC (187 KB)"

To address this, we introduce Multi-residual Task Learning (MRTL), a generic learning framework based on multi-task learning that, for a set of task scenarios, decomposes the control into nominal components that are effectively solved by conventional control methods and residual terms which are solved using learning. We employ MRTL for fleet-level emission reduction in mixed traffic using autonomous vehicles as a means of system control. By analyzing the performance of MRTL across nearly 600 signalized intersections and 1200 traffic scenarios, we demonstrate that it emerges as a promising approach to synergize the strengths of DRL and conventional methods in generalizable control.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 05:25:34 UTC (4,989 KB)"

Yet most modern label-free microscopy modalities target only a fraction of the contrast afforded by an optical absorption interaction. We introduce a comprehensive optical absorption microscopy technique, Photon Absorption Remote Sensing (PARS), which simultaneously captures the dominant light matter interactions which occur as a pulse of light is absorbed by a molecule. In PARS, the optical scattering, attenuation, and the transient radiative and non-radiative relaxation processes are collected at each optical absorption event. This provides a complete representation of the absorption event, providing unique contrast presented here as the total absorption (TA) and quantum efficiency ratio (QER) measurements. By capturing a complete view of each absorption interaction, PARS bridges many of the specificity challenges associated with label-free imaging, facilitating recovery of a wider range of biomolecules than independent radiative or non-radiative modalities. To show the versatility of PARS, we explore imaging across a wide range of biological specimens, from single cells to in-vivo imaging of living subjects. These examples of label-free histopathological imaging, and vascular imaging illustrate some of the numerous fields where PARS may have profound impacts. Overall PARS may provide comprehensive label-free contrast in a wide variety of biological specimens, providing otherwise inaccessible visualizations, and representing a new a source of rich data to develop new AI and machine learning methods for diagnostics and visualization.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 05:15:40 UTC (2,483 KB)"

These formal trade-offs are often taken by researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers to directly imply corresponding tensions between underlying values. Thus interpreted, the trade-offs have formed a core focus of normative engagement in AI governance, accompanied by a particular division of labor along disciplinary lines. This paper argues against this prevalent interpretation by drawing attention to three sets of considerations that are critical for bridging the gap between these formal trade-offs and their practical impacts on relevant values. I show how neglecting these considerations can distort our normative deliberations, and result in costly and misaligned interventions and justifications. Taken together, these considerations form a sociotechnical framework that could guide those involved in AI governance to assess how, in many cases, we can and should have higher aspirations than the prevalent interpretation of the trade-offs would suggest.

The goal of causal modelling is to predict the effects of interventions in an environment, while the goal of reinforcement learning is to select interventions that maximize the rewards the agent receives from the environment. Reinforcement learning includes the two most powerful sources of information for estimating causal relationships: temporal ordering and the ability to act on an environment. This paper examines which reinforcement learning settings we can expect to benefit from causal modelling, and how. In online learning, the agent has the ability to interact directly with their environment, and learn from exploring it. Our main argument is that in online learning, conditional probabilities are causal, and therefore offline RL is the setting where causal learning has the most potential to make a difference. Essentially, the reason is that when an agent learns from their {\em own} experience, there are no unobserved confounders that influence both the agent's own exploratory actions and the rewards they receive. Our paper formalizes this argument. For offline RL, where an agent may and typically does learn from the experience of {\em others}, we describe previous and new methods for leveraging a causal model, including support for counterfactual queries.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 04:49:48 UTC (1,430 KB)"

In this article, we assess the universality of all openly available UIPs, namely MACE, CHGNet, and M3GNet, in a representative task of generalization: calculation of surface energies. We find that the out-of-the-box foundational models have significant shortcomings in this task, with errors correlated to the total energy of surface simulations, having an out-of-domain distance from the training dataset.

By using this dataset, we demonstrate that \textit{system-induced data heterogeneity} negatively impacts accuracy, and deteriorates fairness and domain generalization problems in FL. To address these challenges, we propose HeteroSwitch, which adaptively adopts generalization techniques (i.e., ISP transformation and SWAD) depending on the level of bias caused by varying HW and SW configurations.

A promising solution is the use of learning from experience, i.e., Reinforcement Learning. In multi-agent (social) environments, complex population-level phenomena may emerge from interactions between individual learning agents. Many of the existing studies rely on simulated social dilemma environments to study the interactions of independent learning agents. However, they tend to ignore the moral heterogeneity that is likely to be present in societies of agents in practice. For example, at different points in time a single learning agent may face opponents who are consequentialist (i.e., caring about maximizing some outcome over time) or norm-based (i.e., focusing on conforming to a specific norm here and now). The extent to which agents' co-development may be impacted by such moral heterogeneity in populations is not well understood. In this paper, we present a study of the learning dynamics of morally heterogeneous populations interacting in a social dilemma setting. Using a Prisoner's Dilemma environment with a partner selection mechanism, we investigate the extent to which the prevalence of diverse moral agents in populations affects individual agents' learning behaviors and emergent population-level outcomes. We observe several types of non-trivial interactions between pro-social and anti-social agents, and find that certain classes of moral agents are able to steer selfish agents towards more cooperative behavior.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 04:12:24 UTC (28,479 KB)"

These concerns have sparked interest in applying different techniques to determine reservoir operation policy decisions. As the resolution of the analysis increases, it becomes more difficult to effectively represent a real-world system using traditional methods such as Dynamic Programming (DP) and Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP) for determining the best reservoir operation policy. One of the challenges is the ""curse of dimensionality,"" which means the number of samples needed to estimate an arbitrary function with a given level of accuracy grows exponentially with respect to the number of input variables (i.e., dimensionality) of the function. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is an intelligent approach to overcome the curses of stochastic optimization problems for reservoir operation policy decisions.

Hence, we propose Sample-Wise Activation Patterns and its derivative, SWAP-Score, a novel high-performance training-free metric. It measures the expressivity of networks over a batch of input samples. The SWAP-Score is strongly correlated with ground-truth performance across various search spaces and tasks, outperforming 15 existing training-free metrics on NAS-Bench-101/201/301 and TransNAS-Bench-101.

Nevertheless, when applying policy gradients to SDEs, since the policy gradient is estimated on a finite set of trajectories, it can be ill-defined, and the policy behavior in data-scarce regions may be uncontrolled. This challenge compromises the stability of policy gradients and negatively impacts sample complexity. To address these issues, we propose constraining the SDE to be consistent with its associated perturbation process. Since the perturbation process covers the entire space and is easy to sample, we can mitigate the aforementioned problems.

"105","FL-GUARD: A Holistic Framework for Run-Time Detection and Recovery of Negative Federated Learning","Hong Lin, Lidan Shou, Ke Chen, Gang Chen, Sai Wu","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach for learning a model from data distributed on massive clients without exposing data privacy. It works effectively in the ideal federation where clients share homogeneous data distribution and learning behavior. However, FL may fail to function appropriately when the federation is not ideal, amid an unhealthy state called Negative Federated Learning (NFL), in which most clients gain no benefit from participating in FL. Many studies have tried to address NFL. However, their solutions either (1) predetermine to prevent NFL in the entire learning life-cycle or (2) tackle NFL in the aftermath of numerous learning rounds. Thus, they either (1) indiscriminately incur extra costs even if FL can perform well without such costs or (2) waste numerous learning rounds. Additionally, none of the previous work takes into account the clients who may be unwilling/unable to follow the proposed NFL solutions when using those solutions to upgrade an FL system in use. This paper introduces FL-GUARD, a holistic framework that can be employed on any FL system for tackling NFL in a run-time paradigm. That is, to dynamically detect NFL at the early stage (tens of rounds) of learning and then to activate recovery measures when necessary. Specifically, we devise a cost-effective NFL detection mechanism, which relies on an estimation of performance gain on clients. Only when NFL is detected, we activate the NFL recovery process, in which each client learns in parallel an adapted model when training the global model. Extensive experiment results confirm the effectiveness of FL-GUARD in detecting NFL and recovering from NFL to a healthy learning state. We also show that FL-GUARD is compatible with previous NFL solutions and robust against clients unwilling/unable to take any recovery measures.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 01:52:05 UTC (2,187 KB)"
"106","A Crosstalk-Aware Timing Prediction Method in Routing","Leilei Jin, Jiajie Xu, Wenjie Fu, Hao Yan, Longxing Shi","Systems and Control (eess.SY)","With shrinking interconnect spacing in advanced technology nodes, existing timing predictions become less precise due to the challenging quantification of crosstalk-induced delay. During the routing, the crosstalk effect is typically modeled by predicting coupling capacitance with congestion information. However, the timing estimation tends to be overly pessimistic, as the crosstalk-induced delay depends not only on the coupling capacitance but also on the signal arrival time. This work presents a crosstalk-aware timing estimation method using a two-step machine learning approach. Interconnects that are physically adjacent and overlap in signal timing windows are filtered first. Crosstalk delay is predicted by integrating physical topology and timing features without relying on post-routing results and the parasitic extraction. Experimental results show a match rate of over 99% for identifying crosstalk nets compared to the commercial tool on the OpenCores benchmarks, with prediction results being more accurate than those of other state-of-the-art methods.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 01:50:56 UTC (8,708 KB)"

A key challenge in FL is the uneven data distribution across client devices, violating the well-known assumption of independent-and-identically-distributed (IID) training samples in conventional machine learning. Clustered federated learning (CFL) addresses this challenge by grouping clients based on the similarity of their data distributions. However, existing CFL approaches require a large number of communication rounds for stable cluster formation and rely on a predefined number of clusters, thus limiting their flexibility and adaptability. This paper proposes FedClust, a novel CFL approach leveraging correlations between local model weights and client data distributions. FedClust groups clients into clusters in a one-shot manner using strategically selected partial model weights and dynamically accommodates newcomers in real-time. Experimental results demonstrate FedClust outperforms baseline approaches in terms of accuracy and communication costs.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 01:50:36 UTC (167 KB)"

Root cause analysis (RCA), a critical part of the incident management process, is a demanding task for on-call engineers, requiring deep domain knowledge and extensive experience with a team's specific services. Automation of RCA can result in significant savings of time, and ease the burden of incident management on on-call engineers. Recently, researchers have utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform RCA, and have demonstrated promising results. However, these approaches are not able to dynamically collect additional diagnostic information such as incident related logs, metrics or databases, severely restricting their ability to diagnose root causes. In this work, we explore the use of LLM based agents for RCA to address this limitation. We present a thorough empirical evaluation of a ReAct agent equipped with retrieval tools, on an out-of-distribution dataset of production incidents collected at Microsoft. Results show that ReAct performs competitively with strong retrieval and reasoning baselines, but with highly increased factual accuracy. We then extend this evaluation by incorporating discussions associated with incident reports as additional inputs for the models, which surprisingly does not yield significant performance improvements. Lastly, we conduct a case study with a team at Microsoft to equip the ReAct agent with tools that give it access to external diagnostic services that are used by the team for manual RCA. Our results show how agents can overcome the limitations of prior work, and practical considerations for implementing such a system in practice.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 00:44:01 UTC (578 KB)"

To address these challenges, we introduce the Stable Neural Dynamical System (SNDS), an imitation learning regime which produces a policy with formal stability guarantees. We deploy a neural policy architecture that facilitates the representation of stability based on Lyapunov theorem, and jointly train the policy and its corresponding Lyapunov candidate to ensure global stability. We validate our approach by conducting extensive experiments in simulation and successfully deploying the trained policies on a real-world manipulator arm.

Although ML is undeniably useful for identifying patterns in large, complex data sets, its widespread application in biological sciences represents a significant deviation from traditional methods of scientific inquiry. As such, the interplay between these models and scientific understanding in biology is a topic with important implications for the future of scientific research, yet it is a subject that has received little attention. Here, we draw from an epistemological toolkit to contextualize recent applications of ML in biological sciences under modern philosophical theories of understanding, identifying general principles that can guide the design and application of ML systems to model biological phenomena and advance scientific knowledge. We propose that conceptions of scientific understanding as information compression, qualitative intelligibility, and dependency relation modelling provide a useful framework for interpreting ML-mediated understanding of biological systems. Through a detailed analysis of two key application areas of ML in modern biological research - protein structure prediction and single cell RNA-sequencing - we explore how these features have thus far enabled ML systems to advance scientific understanding of their target phenomena, how they may guide the development of future ML models, and the key obstacles that remain in preventing ML from achieving its potential as a tool for biological discovery. Consideration of the epistemological features of ML applications in biology will improve the prospects of these methods to solve important problems and advance scientific understanding of living systems.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 23:20:34 UTC (1,634 KB)"

This paper presents a systematic overview of patent-related tasks and popular methodologies with a special focus on evolving and promising techniques. Language processing and particularly large language models as well as the recent boost of general generative methods promise to become game changers in the patent field.

However, previous multi-objective optimization methods often focus on a few number of objectives and cannot scale to many objectives that outnumber the solutions, leading to either subpar performance or ignored objectives. We introduce Many-objective multi-solution Transport (MosT), a framework that finds multiple diverse solutions in the Pareto front of many objectives. Our insight is to seek multiple solutions, each performing as a domain expert and focusing on a specific subset of objectives while collectively covering all of them. MosT formulates the problem as a bi-level optimization of weighted objectives for each solution, where the weights are defined by an optimal transport between the objectives and solutions. Our algorithm ensures convergence to Pareto stationary solutions for complementary subsets of objectives. On a range of applications in federated learning, multi-task learning, and mixture-of-prompt learning for LLMs, MosT distinctly outperforms strong baselines, delivering high-quality, diverse solutions that profile the entire Pareto frontier, thus ensuring balanced trade-offs across many objectives.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 23:03:12 UTC (2,736 KB)"

The framework can also simulate the scattered field due to rigid scatterers having arbitrary shape as well as high-frequency problems. Unlike conventional data-driven neural networks, the PINN is trained by directly enforcing the governing equations describing the underlying physics, hence without relying on any labeled training dataset. Remarkably, the network model has significantly lower discretization dependence and offers simulation capabilities akin to parallel computation. This feature is particularly beneficial to address computational challenges typically associated with conventional mesh-dependent simulation methods. The performance of the network is investigated via a comprehensive numerical study that explores different application scenarios based on acoustic scattering.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 22:45:52 UTC (6,638 KB)"

In recent years, machine learning models have proliferated for analyzing EHR data to predict patients future health conditions. Among them, some studies advocate for multi-task learning (MTL) to jointly predict multiple target diseases for improving the prediction performance over single task learning. Nevertheless, current MTL frameworks for EHR data have significant limitations due to their heavy reliance on human experts to identify task groups for joint training and design model architectures. To reduce human intervention and improve the framework design, we propose an automated approach named AutoDP, which can search for the optimal configuration of task grouping and architectures simultaneously. To tackle the vast joint search space encompassing task combinations and architectures, we employ surrogate model-based optimization, enabling us to efficiently discover the optimal solution. Experimental results on real-world EHR data demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed AutoDP framework.

These sorts of probabilistic inference questions are challenging when observations are high-dimensional. In this paper, we show how these questions can have compact, closed form solutions in terms of learned representations. The key idea is to apply a variant of contrastive learning to time series data. Prior work already shows that the representations learned by contrastive learning encode a probability ratio. By extending prior work to show that the marginal distribution over representations is Gaussian, we can then prove that joint distribution of representations is also Gaussian. Taken together, these results show that representations learned via temporal contrastive learning follow a Gauss-Markov chain, a graphical model where inference (e.g., prediction, planning) over representations corresponds to inverting a low-dimensional matrix. In one special case, inferring intermediate representations will be equivalent to interpolating between the learned representations. We validate our theory using numerical simulations on tasks up to 46-dimensions.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 22:27:30 UTC (4,265 KB)"

Minimizing these upper-bounds requires solving implicit equations to obtain a sequence of strongly adapted step-sizes; we show that these equations are straightforward to solve for convex quadratics and lead to new guarantees for two classical step-sizes. For general functions, we prove that the Polyak step-size and normalized GD obtain fast, path-dependent rates despite using no knowledge of the directional smoothness.

These fluctuations and disruptions lead to delays and overcrowding, which are detrimental to the passengers' experience and to the overall performance of the transit service. To proactively mitigate such events, many transit agencies station substitute (reserve) vehicles throughout their service areas, which they can dispatch to augment or replace vehicles on routes that suffer overcrowding or disruption. However, determining the optimal locations where substitute vehicles should be stationed is a challenging problem due to the inherent randomness of disruptions and due to the combinatorial nature of selecting locations across a city. In collaboration with the transit agency of Nashville, TN, we address this problem by introducing data-driven statistical and machine-learning models for forecasting disruptions and an effective randomized local-search algorithm for selecting locations where substitute vehicles are to be stationed. Our research demonstrates promising results in proactive disruption management, offering a practical and easily implementable solution for transit agencies to enhance the reliability of their services.

Motivated by this observation, we propose two simple, computationally cheap vulnerability-aware reweighting functions for assigning perturbation bounds to adversarial examples used for AT, named Margin-Weighted Perturbation Budget (MWPB) and Standard-Deviation-Weighted Perturbation Budget (SDWPB). The proposed methods assign perturbation radii to individual adversarial samples based on the vulnerability of their corresponding natural examples.

Existing solutions either introduce a regularization term to improve the smoothness of the trained policy against perturbations or alternatively train the agent's policy and the attacker's policy. However, the former does not provide sufficient protection against strong attacks, while the latter is computationally prohibitive for large environments. In this work, we propose a new robust RL algorithm for deriving a pessimistic policy to safeguard against an agent's uncertainty about true states.

However, it faces a key challenge due to the domain shift that could arise from variations in the channel conditions and environmental settings, potentially degrading the accuracy of RF-based device classification when testing and training data is collected in different domains. This paper introduces a novel solution that leverages contrastive learning to mitigate this domain shift problem. Contrastive learning, a state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approach from deep learning, learns a distance metric such that positive pairs are closer (i.e. more similar) in the learned metric space than negative pairs. When applied to RF fingerprinting, our model treats RF signals from the same transmission as positive pairs and those from different transmissions as negative pairs. Through experiments on wireless and wired RF datasets collected over several days, we demonstrate that our contrastive learning approach captures domain-invariant features, diminishing the effects of domain-specific variations. Our results show large and consistent improvements in accuracy (10.8\% to 27.8\%) over baseline models, thus underscoring the effectiveness of contrastive learning in improving device classification under domain shift.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 20:33:55 UTC (832 KB)"

We provide a general meta-algorithm that leverages an online regression oracle to estimate the unknown safety constraint, and converts the predictions of an online learning oracle to predictions that adhere to the unknown safety constraint. On the theoretical side, our algorithm's regret can be bounded by the regret of the online regression and online learning oracles, the eluder dimension of the model class containing the unknown safety constraint, and a novel complexity measure that captures the difficulty of safe learning. We complement our result with an asymptotic lower bound that shows that the aforementioned complexity measure is necessary.

"132","Learning Guided Automated Reasoning: A Brief Survey","Lasse Blaauwbroek, David Cerna, Thibault Gauthier, Jan Jakubův, Cezary Kaliszyk, Martin Suda, Josef Urban","Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)","Automated theorem provers and formal proof assistants are general reasoning systems that are in theory capable of proving arbitrarily hard theorems, thus solving arbitrary problems reducible to mathematics and logical reasoning. In practice, such systems however face large combinatorial explosion, and therefore include many heuristics and choice points that considerably influence their performance. This is an opportunity for trained machine learning predictors, which can guide the work of such reasoning systems. Conversely, deductive search supported by the notion of logically valid proof allows one to train machine learning systems on large reasoning corpora. Such bodies of proof are usually correct by construction and when combined with more and more precise trained guidance they can be boostrapped into very large corpora, with increasingly long reasoning chains and possibly novel proof ideas. In this paper we provide an overview of several automated reasoning and theorem proving domains and the learning and AI methods that have been so far developed for them. These include premise selection, proof guidance in several settings, AI systems and feedback loops iterating between reasoning and learning, and symbolic classification problems.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 19:59:17 UTC (51 KB)"

Prior research falls into two primary categories: i) Supervised Feature Selection, which identifies the optimal feature subset based on their relevance to the target variable; ii) Unsupervised Feature Selection, which reduces the feature space dimensionality by capturing the essential information within the feature set instead of using target variable. However, SFS approaches suffer from time-consuming processes and limited generalizability due to the dependence on the target variable and downstream ML tasks. UFS methods are constrained by the deducted feature space is latent and untraceable. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative framework for feature selection, which is guided by knockoff features and optimized through reinforcement learning, to identify the optimal and effective feature subset. In detail, our method involves generating ""knockoff"" features that replicate the distribution and characteristics of the original features but are independent of the target variable. Each feature is then assigned a pseudo label based on its correlation with all the knockoff features, serving as a novel metric for feature evaluation. Our approach utilizes these pseudo labels to guide the feature selection process in 3 novel ways, optimized by a single reinforced agent: 1). A deep Q-network, pre-trained with the original features and their corresponding pseudo labels, is employed to improve the efficacy of the exploration process in feature selection. 2). We introduce unsupervised rewards to evaluate the feature subset quality based on the pseudo labels and the feature space reconstruction loss to reduce dependencies on the target variable. 3). A new {\epsilon}-greedy strategy is used, incorporating insights from the pseudo labels to make the feature selection process more effective.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 19:58:19 UTC (2,738 KB)"

Such questions are of particular interest to educators, who worry that these tools enable a new form of academic dishonesty, in which students submit AI generated code as their own work. Our research explores the viability of using code stylometry and machine learning to distinguish between GPT-4 generated and human-authored code. Our dataset comprises human-authored solutions from CodeChef and AI-authored solutions generated by GPT-4. Our classifier outperforms baselines, with an F1-score and AUC-ROC score of 0.91. A variant of our classifier that excludes gameable features (e.g., empty lines, whitespace) still performs well with an F1-score and AUC-ROC score of 0.89. We also evaluated our classifier with respect to the difficulty of the programming problem and found that there was almost no difference between easier and intermediate problems, and the classifier performed only slightly worse on harder problems. Our study shows that code stylometry is a promising approach for distinguishing between GPT-4 generated code and human-authored code.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 19:51:26 UTC (874 KB)"

Loftus, Parisa Rashidi, Azra Bihorac, Benjamin Shickel","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","The breadth, scale, and temporal granularity of modern electronic health records (EHR) systems offers great potential for estimating personalized and contextual patient health trajectories using sequential deep learning. However, learning useful representations of EHR data is challenging due to its high dimensionality, sparsity, multimodality, irregular and variable-specific recording frequency, and timestamp duplication when multiple measurements are recorded simultaneously. Although recent efforts to fuse structured EHR and unstructured clinical notes suggest the potential for more accurate prediction of clinical outcomes, less focus has been placed on EHR embedding approaches that directly address temporal EHR challenges by learning time-aware representations from multimodal patient time series. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic embedding and tokenization framework for precise representation of multimodal clinical time series that combines novel methods for encoding time and sequential position with temporal cross-attention. Our embedding and tokenization framework, when integrated into a multitask transformer classifier with sliding window attention, outperformed baseline approaches on the exemplar task of predicting the occurrence of nine postoperative complications of more than 120,000 major inpatient surgeries using multimodal data from three hospitals and two academic health centers in the United States.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 19:46:44 UTC (247 KB)"

Firstly, we introduce outlier injection methods that create more diverse and graph-based anomalies in graph datasets. Secondly, we compare methods employing message passing against those without, uncovering the unexpected decline in performance associated with message passing.

Recent advances at the intersection of control and RL follow a two-stage, safety filter approach to enforcing hard safety constraints: model-free RL is used to learn a potentially unsafe controller, whose actions are projected onto safe sets prescribed, for example, by a control barrier function. Though safe, such approaches lose any convergence guarantees enjoyed by the underlying RL methods. In this paper, we develop a single-stage, sampling-based approach to hard constraint satisfaction that learns RL controllers enjoying classical convergence guarantees while satisfying hard safety constraints throughout training and deployment. We validate the efficacy of our approach in simulation, including safe control of a quadcopter in a challenging obstacle avoidance problem, and demonstrate that it outperforms existing benchmarks.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 19:39:20 UTC (3,094 KB)"

Probabilistic methods capture the inherent uncertainty associated with prediction in these contexts, with autoregressive models being especially prominent. This dissertation focuses on using autoregressive models to answer complex probabilistic queries that go beyond single-step prediction, such as the timing of future events or the likelihood of a specific event occurring before another. In particular, we develop a broad class of novel and efficient approximation techniques for marginalization in sequential models that are model-agnostic. These techniques rely solely on access to and sampling from next-step conditional distributions of a pre-trained autoregressive model, including both traditional parametric models as well as more recent neural autoregressive models. Specific approaches are presented for discrete sequential models, for marked temporal point processes, and for stochastic jump processes, each tailored to a well-defined class of informative, long-range probabilistic queries.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 19:29:08 UTC (20,431 KB)"

In an attempt to exemplify such a development by inspiring how humans acquire knowledge and transfer skills among tasks, we introduce a novel multi-task reinforcement learning framework named Episodic Return Progress with Bidirectional Progressive Neural Networks (ERP-BPNN). The proposed ERP-BPNN model (1) learns in a human-like interleaved manner by (2) autonomous task switching based on a novel intrinsic motivation signal and, in contrast to existing methods, (3) allows bidirectional skill transfer among tasks. ERP-BPNN is a general architecture applicable to several multi-task learning settings; in this paper, we present the details of its neural architecture and show its ability to enable effective learning and skill transfer among morphologically different robots in a reaching task. The developed Bidirectional Progressive Neural Network (BPNN) architecture enables bidirectional skill transfer without requiring incremental training and seamlessly integrates with online task arbitration. The task arbitration mechanism developed is based on soft Episodic Return progress (ERP), a novel intrinsic motivation (IM) signal. To evaluate our method, we use quantifiable robotics metrics such as 'expected distance to goal' and 'path straightness' in addition to the usual reward-based measure of episodic return common in reinforcement learning. With simulation experiments, we show that ERP-BPNN achieves faster cumulative convergence and improves performance in all metrics considered among morphologically different robots compared to the baselines.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 19:17:49 UTC (2,534 KB)"
"140","Video Relationship Detection Using Mixture of Experts","Ala Shaabana, Zahra Gharaee, Paul Fieguth","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","Machine comprehension of visual information from images and videos by neural networks faces two primary challenges. Firstly, there exists a computational and inference gap in connecting vision and language, making it difficult to accurately determine which object a given agent acts on and represent it through language. Secondly, classifiers trained by a single, monolithic neural network often lack stability and generalization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MoE-VRD, a novel approach to visual relationship detection utilizing a mixture of experts. MoE-VRD identifies language triplets in the form of < subject, predicate, object> tuples to extract relationships from visual processing. Leveraging recent advancements in visual relationship detection, MoE-VRD addresses the requirement for action recognition in establishing relationships between subjects (acting) and objects (being acted upon). In contrast to single monolithic networks, MoE-VRD employs multiple small models as experts, whose outputs are aggregated. Each expert in MoE-VRD specializes in visual relationship learning and object tagging. By utilizing a sparsely-gated mixture of experts, MoE-VRD enables conditional computation and significantly enhances neural network capacity without increasing computational complexity. Our experimental results demonstrate that the conditional computation capabilities and scalability of the mixture-of-experts approach lead to superior performance in visual relationship detection compared to state-of-the-art methods.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 19:08:34 UTC (1,129 KB)"
"141","Effect of Ambient-Intrinsic Dimension Gap on Adversarial Vulnerability","Rajdeep Haldar, Yue Xing, Qifan Song","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","The existence of adversarial attacks on machine learning models imperceptible to a human is still quite a mystery from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we introduce two notions of adversarial attacks: natural or on-manifold attacks, which are perceptible by a human/oracle, and unnatural or off-manifold attacks, which are not. We argue that the existence of the off-manifold attacks is a natural consequence of the dimension gap between the intrinsic and ambient dimensions of the data. For 2-layer ReLU networks, we prove that even though the dimension gap does not affect generalization performance on samples drawn from the observed data space, it makes the clean-trained model more vulnerable to adversarial perturbations in the off-manifold direction of the data space. Our main results provide an explicit relationship between the $\ell_2,\ell_{\infty}$ attack strength of the on/off-manifold attack and the dimension gap.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 15:41:21 UTC (893 KB)"

In this study, we empirically assess the extrapolation capability of state-of-the-art template-free models by meticulously assembling an extensive set of out-of-distribution (OOD) reactions. Our findings demonstrate that while template-free models exhibit potential in predicting precursors with novel synthesis rules, their top-10 exact-match accuracy in OOD reactions is strikingly modest (< 1%). Furthermore, despite the capability of generating novel reactions, our investigation highlights a recurring issue where more than half of the novel reactions predicted by template-free models are chemically implausible. Consequently, we advocate for the future development of template-free models that integrate considerations of chemical feasibility when navigating unexplored regions of reaction space.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 00:48:17 UTC (956 KB)"

To tackle this challenging problem, we present 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3), a novel visual imitation learning approach that incorporates the power of 3D visual representations into diffusion policies, a class of conditional action generative models. The core design of DP3 is the utilization of a compact 3D visual representation, extracted from sparse point clouds with an efficient point encoder. In our experiments involving 72 simulation tasks, DP3 successfully handles most tasks with just 10 demonstrations and surpasses baselines with a 55.3% relative improvement. In 4 real robot tasks, DP3 demonstrates precise control with a high success rate of 85%, given only 40 demonstrations of each task, and shows excellent generalization abilities in diverse aspects, including space, viewpoint, appearance, and instance. Interestingly, in real robot experiments, DP3 rarely violates safety requirements, in contrast to baseline methods which frequently do, necessitating human intervention.

These functions, parameterized by neural networks, are trained using a mean squared error regression objective to match bootstrapped target values. However, scaling value-based RL methods that use regression to large networks, such as high-capacity Transformers, has proven challenging. This difficulty is in stark contrast to supervised learning: by leveraging a cross-entropy classification loss, supervised methods have scaled reliably to massive networks. Observing this discrepancy, in this paper, we investigate whether the scalability of deep RL can also be improved simply by using classification in place of regression for training value functions. We demonstrate that value functions trained with categorical cross-entropy significantly improves performance and scalability in a variety of domains. These include: single-task RL on Atari 2600 games with SoftMoEs, multi-task RL on Atari with large-scale ResNets, robotic manipulation with Q-transformers, playing Chess without search, and a language-agent Wordle task with high-capacity Transformers, achieving state-of-the-art results on these domains. Through careful analysis, we show that the benefits of categorical cross-entropy primarily stem from its ability to mitigate issues inherent to value-based RL, such as noisy targets and non-stationarity. Overall, we argue that a simple shift to training value functions with categorical cross-entropy can yield substantial improvements in the scalability of deep RL at little-to-no cost.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 18:55:47 UTC (2,577 KB)"

Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, can explore the environment autonomously to learn robust behaviors but may require impractical amounts of unsafe real-world data collection. To learn performant, robust policies without the burden of unsafe real-world data collection or extensive human supervision, we propose RialTo, a system for robustifying real-world imitation learning policies via reinforcement learning in ""digital twin"" simulation environments constructed on the fly from small amounts of real-world data. To enable this real-to-sim-to-real pipeline, RialTo proposes an easy-to-use interface for quickly scanning and constructing digital twins of real-world environments.

Dimitrov, Maximilian Baader, Mark Niklas Müller, Martin Vechev","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Federated learning is a popular framework for collaborative machine learning where multiple clients only share gradient updates on their local data with the server and not the actual data. Unfortunately, it was recently shown that gradient inversion attacks can reconstruct this data from these shared gradients. Existing attacks enable exact reconstruction only for a batch size of $b=1$ in the important honest-but-curious setting, with larger batches permitting only approximate reconstruction. In this work, we propose \emph{the first algorithm reconstructing whole batches with $b >1$ exactly}. This approach combines mathematical insights into the explicit low-rank structure of gradients with a sampling-based algorithm. Crucially, we leverage ReLU-induced gradient sparsity to precisely filter out large numbers of incorrect samples, making a final reconstruction step tractable. We provide an efficient GPU implementation for fully connected networks and show that it recovers batches of $b \lesssim 25$ elements exactly while being tractable for large network widths and depths.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 18:52:39 UTC (2,146 KB)"

In this work, we show that, even within a single model, we can find multiple subnetworks that perform similarly in-domain, but generalize vastly differently. To better understand these phenomena, we investigate if they can be understood in terms of ""competing subnetworks"": the model initially represents a variety of distinct algorithms, corresponding to different subnetworks, and generalization occurs when it ultimately converges to one. This explanation has been used to account for generalization in simple algorithmic tasks. Instead of finding competing subnetworks, we find that all subnetworks -- whether they generalize or not -- share a set of attention heads, which we refer to as the heuristic core. Further analysis suggests that these attention heads emerge early in training and compute shallow, non-generalizing features. The model learns to generalize by incorporating additional attention heads, which depend on the outputs of the ""heuristic"" heads to compute higher-level features. Overall, our results offer a more detailed picture of the mechanisms for syntactic generalization in pretrained LMs.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 18:50:14 UTC (1,049 KB)"

This approach enables the generation of samples from preceding task distributions, which are more likely to be misclassified in the context of recently encountered classes. Our experimental results show that GUIDE significantly reduces catastrophic forgetting, outperforming conventional random sampling approaches and surpassing recent state-of-the-art methods in continual learning with generative replay.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 18:47:32 UTC (7,225 KB)"
